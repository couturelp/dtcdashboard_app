### Task 041 Summary (2026-02-13)
**Files Created:** beprofit-casestudy-info-191.md through 194.md

**Key Findings:**
- **Technical SEO:** BeProfit has strong technical foundations (CDN, mobile-responsive, fast) but critical gaps exist: incomplete sitemap (only 3 URLs), no structured data (Schema.org), and HTTPS redirect issues
- **On-Page SEO:** Consistent title tag optimization, clean heading hierarchy, keyword-rich URLs, but weaknesses include inconsistent H1 lengths, missing "pricing" keyword in pricing page H1, and minimal image alt text
- **Keyword Strategy:** Focused on "profit analytics" and ecommerce profitability terms with strong platform-specific targeting (Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon). Opportunities exist in comparison content, calculator tools, and long-tail educational keywords
- **Content Marketing:** Active blog with 250+ posts, 1-2 posts/month since 2022, strong content depth (1,850+ word average), SEO-first distribution strategy, but underutilizes conversion tactics (no content upgrades, minimal in-content CTAs, blog posts don't link to product pages)

**Recommendations for Our Build:**
- Implement comprehensive sitemap, structured data (Organization, SoftwareApplication, Article schemas), and perfect HTTPS enforcement from day one
- Create superior on-page SEO with keyword-rich CTAs, comprehensive image alt text, and contextual internal linking
- Target BeProfit's keyword gaps: comparison content, interactive calculators, and long-tail educational keywords
