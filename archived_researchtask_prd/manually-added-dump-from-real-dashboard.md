FieldValueSales2Total Sales$28.25Profit-$96.44Profit Margin-341.39%
Each product card has a small colored square icon (purple tones) to the left of the product name. The XCover Protection Plan shows a deeply negative profit margin in red, suggesting the protection plan costs more to fulfill than it earns.

# BeProfit Marketing Page — Complete Visual Inventory

---

## Page Header

- **Page title:** "Marketing" in large bold black text
- **Green dot indicator** next to the title (likely indicates data is live/synced or the section is active)
- **Date range picker (top right):** "Jan-13-2026 ~ Feb-11-2026" with a calendar icon

### Action Buttons (horizontal row to the right of the title):

| Button | Style | Icon |
|---|---|---|
| **Marketing Simulator** | Solid green/teal fill, white text — primary CTA | Small grid/calculator icon |
| **Refresh Marketing Data** | White/outline with gray border | Circular refresh/sync arrow icon |
| **Ad Integrations** | White/outline with gray border | Puzzle piece or connection icon with a small plus |
| **UTM attribution** | White/outline with gray border | Three horizontal lines with dots (filter/list icon) |

---

## Sub-Navigation Tabs (horizontal, below the header)

Four tabs for different marketing channel views:

| Tab | State |
|---|---|
| **Ad Spend** | Active — purple/dark text with underline indicator |
| **Affiliates & Influencers** | Inactive — gray text |
| **Social** | Inactive — gray text |
| **Email & SMS** | Inactive — gray text |

This confirms BeProfit tracks **four categories of marketing channels**: paid ads, affiliate/influencer, organic social, and email/SMS.

---

## Left Sidebar (visible in Image 2, full view)

**Plan badge:** "Plus" shown above the store name in small text — indicates the account is on the **Plus** plan.

**Store selector:** "Sonic Soak" with "S" purple avatar and dropdown chevron

**Navigation (expanded state for Marketing):**
- Overview (with chevron → submenu)
- Orders
- Products
- **Marketing** (highlighted/active, purple background, expanded):
  - **Ad Spend** (currently active sub-item)
  - **Affiliates & Influencers**
  - **Social**
  - **Email & SMS**
- Fulfillment (with chevron)
- Reports (with chevron)
- Tools (with chevron)
- Insights
- Working Capital (with green "New" badge)

**Bottom of sidebar:**
- Settings (with chevron)
- "3 trial days left" text
- Two small icons (user/team icon and a gear/settings icon)

---

## Filter Bar

### Filter Dropdowns (horizontal row):

| Filter | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Ad Platform (1)** | Has active filter — "(1)" indicates one platform is selected | Dropdown with chevron |
| **Account ID** | No active filter | Dropdown with chevron |
| **Campaign** | No active filter | Dropdown with chevron |
| **Ad Group** | Currently open/expanded (visible in Image 1) | Dropdown with chevron |

### Active Filter Chip:
- **"Google ✕"** shown as a removable filter pill/tag with an X to remove
- **"Clear All"** link in teal/green text next to it

This tells us the user has filtered to show only Google ad data, and the filter system supports multi-level drill-down from Platform → Account → Campaign → Ad Group.

### Ad Group Dropdown (open, Image 1):
The dropdown is currently open and showing:

- **Search field:** Placeholder text "Search by Ad Group name or ID"
- **Section header:** "Google" in bold
- **Four Ad Groups listed** (showing as raw IDs, not friendly names — these are Google Ads internal IDs):
  - `3ccb44fe1e96ca6fc8940b463a59849c`
  - `768536775270f3ebcc5f9d3bec3607d5`
  - `80ecfdeaf214425f90c1c58445039771`
  - `b5d75e73a6a7fe770b854e26ed7f6afc`

**Notable observation:** The Ad Group names are displayed as hash-like IDs rather than human-readable names. This could be a data syncing issue, or how BeProfit ingests Google Ads data when ad groups don't have clean names. This is a potential UX weakness — competitors could display friendly names or at least truncate these with tooltips.

---

## Ad Spend Summary Card (left panel)

**Title:** "Ad Spend"

### Platform Breakdown:

| Platform | Icon | Amount | Bar Color | Bar Fill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Facebook** | Blue Facebook "f" logo | **$2,107** | Blue | ~70% of bar filled |
| **Google** | Multi-color Google "G" logo | **$883.45** | Green/teal | ~30% of bar filled |

Each platform has a horizontal progress bar showing relative spend proportion against a gray track background.

**Total Ad Spend: $2,990** (shown at the bottom of the card in Image 2)

---

## Ad Spend Trend Chart (right panel)

**Title:** "Ad Spend Trend"

### Chart Controls (top right):
- **"By Platform"** dropdown — allows toggling the breakdown dimension
- **"Daily"** dropdown — time granularity selector

### Chart Specifications:

**Chart type:** Dual-axis combination chart (bars + lines)

**X-Axis:** Daily dates from **Jan-13-2026** through **Feb-10-2026** (approximately 29 days), with date labels rotated diagonally. Visible date labels include: Jan-13-2026, Jan-15-2026, Jan-17-2026, Jan-19-2026, Jan-21-2026, Jan-23-2026, Jan-25-2026, Jan-27-2026, Jan-29-2026, Jan-31-2026, Feb-02-2026, Feb-04-2026, Feb-06-2026, Feb-08-2026, Feb-10-2026

**Left Y-Axis (Ad Spend):** Dollar amounts from **$0** to **$120**, with gridlines at $0, $20, $40, $60, $80, $100, $120

**Right Y-Axis (ROAS):** Scale from **-5** to **30**, with gridlines at -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30

### Data Series (4 lines/datasets):

| Series | Color | Style | Axis | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Facebook** | Blue (solid) | Solid line with dot markers | Left (Ad Spend) | Daily Facebook ad spend — volatile, ranging from ~$0 to ~$100, with a notable dip to near $0 around Feb 1-3 then recovery |
| **Google** | Teal/green (solid) | Solid line with dot markers | Left (Ad Spend) | Daily Google ad spend — more consistent, hovering between ~$15-$40 daily, with a dip around Feb 1-3 |
| **ROAS** | Purple/violet (dashed) | Dashed line with larger dot markers | Right (ROAS) | Return on ad spend — highly volatile, spiking to ~25-27 on some days, frequently between 5-15, occasionally dipping negative |
| **POAS** | Dark/black (dashed) | Dashed line with dot markers | Right (ROAS axis) | Profit on ad spend — generally lower than ROAS, mostly hovering between 0-10, occasionally going slightly negative |

**Legend (below chart):**
- Blue square: **Facebook**
- Green square: **Google**
- Purple square: **ROAS**
- Black/dark square: **POAS**

### Chart Behavioral Observations:
- There's a clear **spending pause/dip around Jan 31 – Feb 3** where both Facebook and Google spend dropped significantly, then resumed
- ROAS spikes tend to occur on low-spend days (possibly fewer orders but high-value ones creating misleading daily ROAS)
- The Facebook line is consistently higher than Google, confirming Facebook is the primary ad channel
- POAS tracks below ROAS as expected (profit accounts for costs that revenue does not)

---

## Action Links (below the chart, above the table)

Two buttons/links aligned to the right:

| Button | Icon | Style |
|---|---|---|
| **UTM Attribution FAQ** | Question mark / info circle icon | White/outline button |
| **Export** | Download/export arrow icon | White/outline button |

---

## Platform Performance Data Table

A detailed tabular breakdown of per-platform marketing metrics. This is a **horizontally scrollable table** (indicated by the green scroll bar visible at the bottom in Image 2).

### Column Headers:

| Column | UTM Badge | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Platform** | — | Platform name with logo |
| **Amount Spent ↓** | — | Total spend (sorted descending, indicated by ↓ arrow) |
| **v.expenses** | — | Variable expenses |
| **Impressions** | — | Total ad impressions |
| **Clicks** | — | Total clicks |
| **CPC** | — | Cost per click |
| **Orders** | **UTM** badge | Orders attributed (UTM tag indicates UTM-based attribution) |
| **Revenue** | **UTM** badge | Revenue attributed via UTM |
| **ROAS** | **UTM** badge | Return on ad spend (UTM-attributed) |
| **AOV** | **UTM** badge | Average order value (UTM-attributed) |
| **CPA** | **UTM** badge | Cost per acquisition (UTM-attributed) |
| **POAS** | **UTM** badge | Profit on ad spend (UTM-attributed) |
| **Conver...** | — | Conversion rate (column name truncated) |

**Note:** Several columns have a small **"UTM"** tag/badge next to the header, indicating these metrics are calculated using UTM parameter attribution rather than platform-reported data. This is a significant feature distinction — BeProfit offers UTM-based attribution as an alternative to platform-native attribution.

### Row Data:

**Facebook:**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Platform | Facebook (blue "f" icon, clickable link in teal) |
| Amount Spent | $2,107 |
| v.expenses | $0 |
| Impressions | 50,057 |
| Clicks | 793 |
| CPC | $2.66 |
| Orders (UTM) | **11** (shown in teal/green, likely clickable) |
| Revenue (UTM) | $1,945 |
| ROAS (UTM) | 0.92 |
| AOV (UTM) | $176.81 |
| CPA (UTM) | $191.56 |
| POAS (UTM) | -0.43 |
| Conversion | 1.39% |

**Google:**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Platform | Google (multi-color "G" icon, clickable link in teal) |
| Amount Spent | $883 |
| v.expenses | $0 |
| Impressions | 32,927 |
| Clicks | 857 |
| CPC | $1.03 |
| Orders (UTM) | **9** (shown in teal/green, likely clickable) |
| Revenue (UTM) | $1,457 |
| ROAS (UTM) | 1.65 |
| AOV (UTM) | $161.85 |
| CPA (UTM) | $98.16 |
| POAS (UTM) | 0.05 |
| Conversion | 1.05% |

### Table Analysis Observations:
- **Facebook is underperforming:** ROAS of 0.92 (spending more than earning) and POAS of -0.43 (negative profit return). CPA of $191.56 is nearly double Google's $98.16
- **Google is more efficient:** Lower CPC ($1.03 vs $2.66), higher ROAS (1.65 vs 0.92), much lower CPA, and a slightly positive POAS (0.05)
- **Facebook has higher volume:** More impressions (50K vs 33K) but fewer clicks per impression, suggesting lower CTR
- **Orders column values are clickable** (teal colored) — likely drill down to see the specific orders attributed to each platform
- **v.expenses is $0 for both** — this field exists for tracking additional variable marketing expenses beyond ad spend (e.g., agency fees, creative costs)
- The **horizontal scroll bar** (green) at the bottom indicates more columns may be visible by scrolling right — the "Conver..." column is truncated, suggesting there could be additional columns beyond conversion rate

---

## Footer (Image 2)

- **BeProfit logo** (purple "B" icon + "BeProfit" text)
- **Social media icons:** YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn
- **Disclaimer text:** "The data displayed is based on the information provided by you and by third-party platforms and Become is not responsible f... Insights are provided for informational purposes only and are not intended to constitute financial advice."
- **Links:** "Terms & Condition" | "Privacy Policy"
- **Chat widget (far right):** "Ask me anything..." text input with a send arrow icon — support/help chat

---

## Key Product Intelligence from This View

**Features confirmed:**
1. **Multi-platform ad tracking** — Facebook and Google confirmed, likely more available via "Ad Integrations"
2. **Four marketing channel categories** — Ad Spend, Affiliates & Influencers, Social, Email & SMS
3. **Hierarchical filtering** — Platform → Account ID → Campaign → Ad Group (4 levels deep)
4. **UTM-based attribution** — Separate from platform-reported metrics, giving merchants an independent measurement
5. **POAS metric (Profit on Ad Spend)** — Differentiator vs basic ROAS; factors in actual product costs
6. **Marketing Simulator** — Prominent green CTA, suggesting a what-if/scenario planning tool
7. **Manual data refresh** — "Refresh Marketing Data" button suggests data isn't always real-time
8. **Export functionality** — Users can export marketing data
9. **UTM Attribution FAQ** — They have education/help content directly accessible from the page
10. **Dual-axis charting** — Spend overlaid with ROAS/POAS for at-a-glance performance context
11. **Clickable drill-downs** — Platform names and order counts are interactive links
12. **Variable expenses tracking** — Column exists for additional marketing costs beyond ad spend

**UX Weaknesses observed:**
1. Ad Group IDs displayed as raw hashes — poor readability
2. The filter dropdown doesn't show checkboxes or selection state clearly
3. ROAS spikes on low-spend days can be misleading without volume context on the chart
4. Column truncation ("Conver...") without a tooltip visible
5. No visible totals row at the bottom of the data table

# BeProfit Settings & Integration Pages — Complete Visual Inventory

---

## IMAGE 1: Settings → Workspace Tab

### Page Header
- **Title:** "Settings" in large bold text
- **Subtitle:** "All your settings in one place" in gray text

### Settings Tab Navigation (horizontal):
| Tab | State |
|---|---|
| Costs | Inactive |
| Other Revenue | Inactive |
| Shop | Inactive |
| User | Inactive |
| **Workspace** | **Active** — purple text with underline indicator |

---

### Workspace Info Card (top card)

A horizontal summary bar with four fields:

| Field | Value | Editable? |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace name | **Sonic Soak Workspace** | Yes — external link/edit icon (pencil-in-square ✏️) next to it |
| Subscribed Shops | **1** | Display only |
| Teammates | **1** | Display only |
| Currency | **USD** | Yes — external link/edit icon next to it |

This reveals a **workspace-level architecture** — the workspace is the top-level container that holds shops, teammates, and a base currency. This is a multi-tenant/multi-store pattern.

---

### Shops Section

**Title:** "Shops" in bold

A table with three columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Platforms | Platform name with logo icon |
| Subscribed Shops | Number of connected shops |
| Action | "+ Add Shop" link |

#### Platform Rows:

| Platform | Logo | Subscribed Shops | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Amazon** | Amazon "a" logo (smile arrow, circular gray icon) | **-** (none connected) | "+ Add Shop" (teal/green link) |
| **Wix** | "WiX" logo in circular gray icon | **-** (none connected) | "+ Add Shop" |
| **Shopify** | Green Shopify bag logo in circular icon | **1 Shop** | "+ Add Shop" |
| **Woo Commerce** | Purple WooCommerce "Woo" logo in circular icon | **-** (none connected) | "+ Add Shop" |

**Additional details:**
- The **Shopify row** has a **right-pointing chevron (>)** at the far left, indicating it's expandable — clicking would likely reveal the connected shop name ("Sonic Soak") and its details
- The other three rows have no chevron because no shops are connected
- This confirms BeProfit supports **four e-commerce platforms**: Amazon, Wix, Shopify, and WooCommerce
- The architecture supports **multiple shops per platform** (the "+ Add Shop" button is present even on Shopify which already has 1 shop)

---

### Teammates Section (partially visible)

**Title:** "Teammates" in bold
**Action button (top right):** Green/teal button **"Invite New Teammate"** with a person-plus icon

**Table headers visible:**

| Column |
|---|
| Name |
| Status |
| Permissions |

The actual teammate rows are cut off below the fold, but the structure reveals:
- **Team collaboration is supported** with invite functionality
- There's a **permissions system** — teammates can have different access levels
- There's a **status field** — likely "Active", "Pending Invitation", etc.

---

## IMAGE 2: Settings → Shop Tab

### Settings Tab Navigation:
| Tab | State |
|---|---|
| Costs | Inactive |
| Other Revenue | Inactive |
| **Shop** | **Active** — purple text with underline |
| User | Inactive |
| Workspace | Inactive |

### Shop Settings Cards

A card containing four settings items arranged in a 3-column grid (first row has 3, second row has 1):

#### Row 1:

**1. General settings**

- **Title:** "General settings"
- **Subtitle:** "Set your shop formats & Info"

**3. Industries**
- **Icon:** Building/chart icon (outlined, light gray)
- **Title:** "Industries"
- **Subtitle:** "Set the niche you operate in"
- Allows users to categorize their business by industry/niche — likely used for benchmarking, tailored insights, or industry-specific defaults

#### Row 2:

**4. Notification Management**
- **Icon:** Bell icon (outlined, light gray)
- **Title:** "Notification Management"
- **Subtitle:** "Set your communication preferences"
- Controls what notifications/alerts the user receives and through which channels

Each card is clickable (navigates to a sub-page when clicked). The cards have a clean, minimal design with light gray outlined icons, bold title, and gray subtitle text.

## IMAGE 3: Settings → Other Revenue (sub-page)

### Page Header
- **Back arrow (←)** in a circular button — navigates back to main Settings
- **Title:** "Other Revenue"

### Section 1: Integrations Card

**Title:** "Integrations" with a puzzle/connection icon, preceded by a **down chevron (∨)** indicating this section is collapsible/expandable (currently expanded)

**Integration listed:**

| Integration | Icon | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Google Sheets** | Green Google Sheets icon (small) | "Please link sheet" (gray text — not connected) | Green button: **"Sync with Google Sheets"** with a sync/refresh icon |

This reveals that BeProfit allows users to **import custom revenue data via Google Sheets**. This is for revenue that doesn't come through the connected e-commerce platform — wholesale orders, in-person sales, custom invoices, etc.

### Section 2: Custom Revenue (empty state)

**Empty state illustration:** A light purple/lavender circular background with a magnifying glass over a document — the standard "nothing here yet" illustration

**Text:** "No custom revenue yet"

**Action button:** Green/teal button **"+ Add Revenue"**

This confirms users can **manually add custom revenue entries** in addition to (or instead of) syncing from Google Sheets. The two methods together (Google Sheets sync + manual entry) cover revenue that lives outside the connected platforms.

### Costs Settings Cards

A card containing **eleven settings items** arranged in a 3-column grid (4 rows, with the last row having 2 items):

#### Row 1:

**1. Calculation Preferences**
- **Icon:** Document/calculator icon with grid lines
- **Title:** "Calculation Preferences"
- **Subtitle:** "Manage how your data is crunched"
- This is a critical settings page — it likely controls profit calculation methodology: whether to use gross or net sales as the base, how to handle taxes, discount treatment, refund handling, date attribution (order date vs payment date), etc.

**2. Product Costs**
- **Icon:** Shopping bag with dollar/tag icon
- **Title:** "Product Costs"
- **Subtitle:** "Set your product costs"
- Where users configure COGS per product — manually, via CSV, or via integration. This is the core data input that makes the entire product work.

**3. Fulfillment**
- **Icon:** Truck/shipping icon
- **Title:** "Fulfillment"
- **Subtitle:** "Set your shipping & handling preferences"
- Configuration for shipping costs — flat rate, per-order, per-item, weight-based, carrier-specific rates, fulfillment service costs, etc.

#### Row 2:

**4. Operational Expenses**
- **Icon:** Dollar sign in circle/document icon
- **Title:** "Operational Expenses"
- **Subtitle:** "Add your operational expenses"
- Fixed overhead costs: rent, salaries, software subscriptions, insurance — anything that isn't directly tied to an order but affects net profit

**5. Marketing Platforms**
- **Icon:** Paper airplane/megaphone icon
- **Title:** "Marketing Platforms"
- **Subtitle:** "Connect your marketing platforms"
- Where users connect Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, etc. This is the integration hub for ad spend data.

**6. UTM Attribution**
- **Icon:** Chain link icon
- **Title:** "UTM Attribution"
- **Subtitle:** "Dive into ad performance"
- Configuration for UTM-based attribution tracking — likely where users set up UTM parameter mapping, attribution windows, and first-touch vs last-touch models

#### Row 3:

**7. Processing Fees**
- **Icon:** Credit card icon
- **Title:** "Processing Fees"
- **Subtitle:** "Add payment gateway charges"
- Configuration for payment processing costs — Stripe fees, PayPal fees, Shopify Payments percentages, etc. These eat into margins and need to be tracked for accurate profit calculation.

**8. API Access**
- **Icon:** Server/terminal icon
- **Title:** "API Access"
- **Subtitle:** "Update costs over API"
- Confirms BeProfit has an **API for programmatic cost updates**. This is important for businesses with complex supply chains or ERP systems that need to push cost data automatically.

**9. FTP Integration**
- **Icon:** Globe with upload arrow icon
- **Title:** "FTP integration"
- **Subtitle:** "Sync order related costs using an FTP"
- An **FTP-based cost sync** option — for businesses that generate cost files from legacy systems (ERP, warehouse management) and upload them via FTP/SFTP. This is an enterprise-grade feature.

#### Row 4:

**10. Variable and Custom Expenses**
- **Icon:** Square with dollar sign icon
- **Title:** "Variable and Custom Expenses"
- **Subtitle:** "Manage all custom & variable expenses"
- For costs that don't fit into the standard categories — custom duties, packaging costs, insurance per order, marketplace fees, etc.

**11. Returns Setting and Predictions**
- **Icon:** Circular refresh/return arrow icon
- **Title:** "Returns Setting and Predictions"
- **Subtitle:** "Set Predicted cost for returns"
- Configuration for return costs and **predictive return modeling** — this is sophisticated. Users can likely set expected return rates and associated costs so that profit calculations account for anticipated returns before they actually happen.

## IMAGE 5: Connecting Facebook Ad Accounts (Modal Dialog)

### Background (dimmed/grayed out)
Behind the modal, the following is partially visible:
- **"Avail..."** (truncated — likely "Available Integrations") heading
- **"Connect yo..."** subtitle
- **"Manage Integrations"** button (top right, outlined with puzzle icon)
- **"Ad Platfo..."** section header
- **Facebook** row with blue "F" icon and a green checkmark (✓) — already connected

- **"Cust..."** section (truncated — likely "Custom" or "Custom Expenses")
- **"Add Fi..."** text (truncated)
- A gear/settings icon visible
- **"+ C..."** button (truncated — likely "+ Connect" or "+ Custom")
- **"Back"** and **"Save"** (green) buttons at the bottom right of the background page

### Modal: "Connecting Facebook Ad Accounts"

**Header:** "Connecting Facebook Ad Accounts" with an **X** close button (top right)

**User Identity Section:**
- **Profile photo:** Circular user avatar photo (appears to be a couple in the photo)
- **Name:** "Glen Gustia"
- **Auth status:** "Logged in with Facebook" (gray text)
- **Action:** "Logout" link in teal/blue text

**Search Bar:**
- Placeholder: "Search by account name or id"
- Magnifying glass icon

**Ad Account List (scrollable):**

| Account Name | Account ID | Selected? |
|---|---|---|
| **Glen Gunawan** | act_33079891 | **✅ Yes** (teal/green checkbox, row highlighted with light green/teal background) |
| Golden Nest Store | act_1857654611158202 | ☐ No |

The list appears scrollable (scroll indicator visible on right edge), suggesting more accounts may exist below.

**Modal Action Buttons:**
- **"Close"** — white/outline button
- **"Save"** — green/teal solid button

### Key Observations:
- Facebook integration uses **OAuth login** — users authenticate with their Facebook account, then BeProfit pulls all ad accounts associated with that Facebook Business Manager
- Users can **select specific ad accounts** to sync (multi-select with checkboxes)
- Account IDs use the Facebook `act_` prefix format
- The user has **multiple ad accounts across different businesses** visible (Golden Nest Store, GNStore, Exogun, UltrasonaCleaner.com) — typical for agencies or entrepreneurs running multiple brands
- Only one account is currently selected (Glen Gunawan / act_33079891)

## IMAGE 6: Connecting Google Ad Accounts (Modal Dialog)

### Modal: "Connecting Google Ad Accounts"

**Header:** "Connecting Google Ad Accounts" with an **X** close button (top right)

**User Identity Section:**
- **Profile photo:** Same circular user avatar (same user as Facebook modal)
- **Name:** "Glen Gunawan"
- **Auth status:** "Logged in with Google ads" (gray text)
- **Action:** "Logout" link in teal/blue text

**Search Bar:**
- Placeholder: "Search by account name or id"
- Magnifying glass icon

**Ad Account List (scrollable):**

| Account Name | Account ID | Selected? |
|---|---|---|

| PiqoProjector.com | 4761579925 | ☐ No |

| Search & Shopping - Mizu Towel | 5322181715 | ☐ No |

The list appears scrollable, suggesting more accounts below.

**Modal Action Buttons:**
- **"Close"** — white/outline button
- **"Save"** — green/teal solid button

### Background Elements (same as Image 5):
- Same integration settings page visible behind the modal
- Facebook and Google rows both showing green checkmarks ✓
- "Manage Integrations" button top right
- "Back" and "Save" buttons at bottom right

### Key Observations:
- Google Ads integration also uses **OAuth login** — "Logged in with Google ads"
- Google ad account IDs are **numeric** (no prefix, unlike Facebook's `act_` format)
- The user manages **multiple Google Ads accounts across different brands**: xFyro, PiqoProjector, DESKLAB, Mizu Towel, Loom Footwear
- One account has a parenthetical note: "DESKLAB (prev.Maybe)" — the account name was apparently changed, and the old name is preserved
- The same **multi-select checkbox pattern** as Facebook — select which accounts to pull data from
- "Search & Shopping - Mizu Towel" suggests this is a **Google Ads campaign type** (Search & Shopping) used as an account name, revealing how some merchants organize their ad accounts
