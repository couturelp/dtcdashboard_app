# Project Overview

## Project Name
BeProfit Deep Research & Documentation Mission

## Description
An exhaustive competitive intelligence research project on BeProfit (https://beprofit.co/) — a profit analytics and reporting platform for e-commerce businesses. The goal is to build a comprehensive knowledge base by systematically crawling, documenting, and analyzing every aspect of BeProfit's product, marketing, integrations, pricing, user sentiment, and competitive positioning. This research will inform the development of a competing product that serves a similar market with similar and improved capabilities.

## Objective
Understand BeProfit better than their own team does — every feature, every integration, every setting, every user complaint — so we can build a superior competitor.

## Research Methodology
This is a research-only project (no software development). Claude Code will be used with browser automation and web research tools to systematically gather, organize, and analyze information from three primary source categories:

1. **Help Center / Knowledge Base** (https://help.runviably.com/beprofit) — Deep product understanding
2. **Marketing Website** (https://beprofit.co/) — Positioning, pricing, messaging analysis
3. **Broader Web Research** — Reviews, comparisons, market landscape, social media, job postings

## Key Deliverables
- 150-200+ structured markdown research files (`beprofit-casestudy-info-NNN.md`) put those files in the folder /dtcdashboard_app/casestudy that already exist.
- Checkpoint reviews every 10 files
- Final synthesis document (`beprofit-casestudy-info-FINAL-SYNTHESIS.md`)

## Research Areas
- Product features (dashboard, reports, profit calc, COGS, ad tracking, custom reports)
- Integration ecosystem (Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon, Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok, Klaviyo, etc.)
- Pricing & business model (plans, tiers, feature gating, usage limits)
- UI/UX & design patterns (color palette, typography, navigation, components)
- Marketing & positioning (messaging, value props, social proof, conversion tactics)
- User sentiment & reviews (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, Shopify App Store)
- Competitive landscape (alternatives, comparisons, market trends)
- SEO & content strategy (keywords, meta data, content structure)
