## Relevance to Our Build

### Checkpoint Review as a Quality Gate
- Checkpoint reviews prevent incomplete research from accumulating
- Force assessment of data quality and completeness before moving forward
- Identify gaps early so they can be addressed before synthesis phase

### Prioritization for Our Build
- Not all research is equally valuable — checkpoint helps prioritize
- Focus on high-impact insights (pricing, features, positioning) over low-impact details
- Decide which areas of BeProfit to emulate vs differentiate

### Readiness for Implementation Planning
- Complete, high-quality research enables informed implementation decisions
- Missing or low-quality research leads to guesswork and rework
- Checkpoint ensures we have the insights needed to build a superior competitor

### Remaining Work for This PRD
**PRD Part 06 Status: 15 of 15 tasks complete (100% complete — TEMPLATE PHASE DONE)**

All 15 research template files for PRD Part 06 have been created (files 081-095). The template creation phase is complete.

**Next Phase: Manual Research Execution**
All templates must now be populated with actual BeProfit.co marketing website data through manual research using:
- `agent-browser` — Navigate BeProfit.co marketing pages
- `copywriting` — Analyze marketing copy and messaging
- `marketing-psychology` — Analyze persuasion tactics and pricing psychology
- `seo-audit` — Capture SEO metadata and strategy
- `audit-website` — Comprehensive site audit
- Other relevant skills per file requirements

Once all 15 files are populated with actual data (no "[to be filled during research]" placeholders remain), PRD Part 06 will be marked as .DONE and the project will proceed to PRD Part 07 (Blog & Content Strategy).
