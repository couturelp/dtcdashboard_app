## Notes
- PRD Part 02 has 20 tasks total. This task completed 5 (25%).
- The remaining 15 tasks (6-20) will need 2-3 more tasks to complete.
- The next task (005) should cover Tasks 6-10: Product Analytics, Ad Spend Tracking, Custom Reports, Customer Analytics, Shipping Cost Tracking (Detailed).
- Key discovery: BeProfit has NO native mobile app — only an iOS Safari web shortcut. This is a major competitive opportunity.
- The Profit Glossary provided the complete formula chain for all 3 profit tiers (Gross, Contribution, Net) with exact formulas.
- 13 calculation preferences identified that control how metrics are computed across different pages (with Orders, Marketing, and Cohort pages being independently calculated).
- The 6-level COGS priority hierarchy was fully documented with retroactivity behaviors for each method.
