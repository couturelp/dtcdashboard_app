## Implementation Summary

### Research Methodology
- Conducted web searches across 50+ queries
- Analyzed competitor websites, review platforms, and comparison articles
- Synthesized findings into comprehensive strategic reports
- Cited 80+ sources across all research files

### Key Findings

**Competitive Landscape:**
- TrueProfit is primary threat (ranked #1, 34-50% cheaper, 700+ reviews)
- BeProfit typically ranks #2-4 in comparison articles
- Market fragmented by use case (profit tracking, LTV, attribution, budget, premium)

**Critical Weaknesses Identified:**
1. UTM-only ad attribution (misses unattributed spend)
2. No mobile app (competitors have iOS/Android)
3. Higher pricing than alternatives
4. Feature-gating issues (most features in Pro/Ultimate plans)
5. Manual setup requirements

**Strategic Opportunities:**
1. Fix attribution tracking (track ALL ad spend)
2. Launch mobile apps
3. Reintroduce affordable free/low-cost tier
4. Build hybrid transactional + subscription analytics
5. Target "spreadsheet refugees" (merchants at $20-50K/month revenue)
