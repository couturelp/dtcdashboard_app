- File 077: ~750 lines (blog requires detailed post inventory)
- File 078: ~700 lines (legal analysis is comprehensive)

- File 080: ~600 lines (checkpoint review format)
Total: ~3,500 lines across 5 files

### PRD Part 05 Completion Status
After Task 018, PRD Part 05 will have:

- ⏳ Manual research phase pending (user to execute with skills)
- ⏳ Template population pending (requires actual BeProfit.co data)
