- [x] Task 12: Checkpoint Review #7 (file 122)

The PRD explicitly states on line 194: "**PRD PART 07 STATUS: COMPLETE ✅** — All requirements fulfilled."

## Scope

### What This Task WILL Do
- Document PRD Part 07 completion status
- Signal to the system that this PRD should be marked as .DONE
- Indicate readiness to transition to PRD Part 08

### What This Task Will NOT Do
- No implementation work required
- No new research files needed
- No code changes needed

## Files to Create/Modify

**None** - All deliverables have been created by previous tasks (files 111-122 in dtcdashboard_app/casestudy/).

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Verify PRD Completion Status
**Files:** @prd/detailed_prd_part_07.md (READ ONLY)

Verification confirms:
- All 12 cumulative progress checkboxes marked [x] (lines 176-189)
- Status line explicitly states: "PRD PART 07 STATUS: COMPLETE ✅" (line 194)
- "Remaining Work for This PRD: All 12 tasks COMPLETE ✅" (line 192)

**No action required** - verification already passed.

- [x] Checkpoint: Step 1 complete

### Step 2: Signal PRD Completion to Framework
**Files:** N/A

Output signal: `[PRD_ALREADY_COMPLETE]`

This informs the automation framework that:
1. PRD Part 07 has no remaining requirements
2. The PRD file should be renamed from `detailed_prd_part_07.md` to `detailed_prd_part_07.DONE.md`
3. The next task (034) should target PRD Part 08

- [x] Checkpoint: Step 2 complete

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Verified that all 12 PRD requirements are marked complete
- [x] Verified that PRD status line indicates completion
- [x] Signaled PRD completion to the automation framework
- [x] Documented that no implementation work is needed
- [x] Confirmed readiness to transition to next PRD part

## Summary

PRD Part 07 (Broader Web Research — Reviews, Ratings & User Sentiment) has been fully completed across Tasks 023-032. All 12 research files (beprofit-casestudy-info-111.md through beprofit-casestudy-info-122.md) have been created and populated with comprehensive research data covering:

1. Shopify App Store reviews (both general and negative focus)
2. G2, Capterra, and Trustpilot review platforms
3. Alternative review sources (Product Hunt, Reddit, YouTube, GetApp, etc.)
4. User sentiment synthesis (most praised and criticized features)
5. Common feature requests aggregation
6. Churn reasons and support quality analysis
7. Pricing sentiment synthesis
8. Checkpoint review with go/no-go recommendation

**Key Strategic Findings from PRD Part 07:**
- BeProfit's #1 weakness: Google Ads Performance Max attribution bug (missing 40-60% of spend)
- Strong Shopify App Store presence (4.8/5.0, 230+ reviews) but weak alternative channel presence
- Users highly praise: Shopify integration, dashboard UX, multi-store support, real-time tracking
- Primary churn drivers: attribution bugs, pricing concerns, missing integrations, poor support response time
- Go recommendation: Strong market opportunity to build superior alternative focusing on accuracy and trust

The framework should now mark `detailed_prd_part_07.md` as `.DONE` and proceed to PRD Part 08.
