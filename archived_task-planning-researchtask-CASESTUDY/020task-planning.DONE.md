**Files:** dtcdashboard_app/casestudy/beprofit-casestudy-info-081.md (CREATE)

Create a comprehensive research template following the established structure from PRD Part 05 templates (files 071-080). This template maps out ALL feature pages on the marketing site to ensure complete coverage in subsequent files.

**Header Structure:**
```markdown
# BeProfit Features Pages — Overview & Navigation

## Source
- **Primary URL:** https://beprofit.co/features (or equivalent)
- **Category:** Marketing Website / Features Overview
- **Date Captured:** [to be filled during research]
- **Research Status:** ⚠️ TEMPLATE - Requires manual website research

## Research Objective
Identify and catalog all feature-specific pages on BeProfit's marketing website, document how features are grouped and presented in navigation, analyze the feature page template/structure pattern, and create a comprehensive inventory for detailed analysis in files 082-086.
```

**Main Content Sections:**

1. **Feature Pages Inventory**
   - Create table with columns: | Feature Name | URL | Navigation Location | Priority (Primary/Secondary) |
   - Document ALL feature pages found (target: 8-15 pages)
   - Note which features get dedicated pages vs subsections
   - Identify features mentioned in help center but NOT on marketing site

2. **Feature Navigation Analysis**
   - Main navigation structure (top nav, mega menu, dropdown)
   - How features are categorized (by use case, by user role, by workflow)
   - Navigation labels used (exact text)
   - Visual hierarchy (which features appear first, which are buried)
   - Mobile vs desktop navigation differences

3. **Feature Page Template/Structure Pattern**
   - Common template elements across all feature pages
   - Typical page structure (hero → benefits → features → testimonials → CTA)
   - Content blocks used (text, images, videos, demos)
   - CTA placement patterns
   - Page length patterns (short vs long-form)

4. **Feature Grouping Strategy**
   - Primary feature categories (e.g., "Analytics", "Integrations", "Reports")
   - How features are bundled or separated
   - Related features cross-linking patterns
   - Feature hierarchy (parent features vs sub-features)

5. **Feature Positioning Hierarchy**
   - Which features are emphasized as "flagship" or "core"
   - Which features are de-emphasized or buried
   - Visual prominence indicators (page placement, image size, CTA strength)
   - Feature ordering logic

**Analysis Framework:**
- Completeness: Does every major feature from help center have a marketing page?
- Consistency: Is there a consistent template/structure across feature pages?
- Clarity: Is it easy for users to find specific features they're looking for?
- Gaps: What features are under-marketed or missing from marketing site?

**Relevance to Our Build:**
Section documenting which features our competitor should emphasize in marketing, how to structure feature navigation, and gaps in BeProfit's feature marketing we can exploit.

**File size estimate:** ~600 lines
