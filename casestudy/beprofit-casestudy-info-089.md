- [ ] If using "Coming Soon" badges, provide realistic timelines
- [ ] Test integrations thoroughly before marketing setup as "2 clicks" or "automatic"

### Opportunities to Provide Clearer/More Comprehensive Integration Marketing

**Areas Where We Can Out-Market BeProfit:**

1. **Setup Process Transparency**
   - **BeProfit's Weakness:** [If setup isn't actually as easy as claimed]
   - **Our Opportunity:** [Show realistic setup process, provide video tutorials, offer setup assistance]

2. **Integration Depth Documentation**
   - **BeProfit's Weakness:** [If they list integrations but don't clarify what data is synced]
   - **Our Opportunity:** [Detailed data point documentation per integration, sample data tables]

3. **Limit Transparency**
   - **BeProfit's Weakness:** [If integration limits are obscure or buried in pricing page]
   - **Our Opportunity:** [Clear, upfront integration limits per plan tier on integrations page itself]

4. **Under-Marketed Integrations**
   - **BeProfit's Weakness:** [Integrations they have but don't market prominently]
   - **Our Opportunity:** [If we build same integrations, market them prominently as differentiator]

5. **Use Case Specificity**
   - **BeProfit's Weakness:** [If use cases are generic]
   - **Our Opportunity:** [Specific, relatable use cases with real examples and customer stories]

### Integration Ecosystem Strategy

**Build vs Partner vs Integrate:**
- **Build In-House:** [Which integrations should be built internally for best control/quality?]
- **Use Integration Platforms:** [Should we use Zapier/Make/etc. for long-tail integrations?]
- **API-First Approach:** [Provide robust API for customers to build their own integrations?]

**Phased Integration Roadmap:**
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** [5-10 critical integrations to launch with]
- **Phase 2 (Growth):** [Next 10-20 integrations to build momentum]
- **Phase 3 (Maturity):** [Long-tail integrations based on customer requests]

**Integration Marketing Priorities:**
- **Always Featured:** [List integrations that should always be prominently marketed]
- **Contextually Featured:** [List integrations to feature based on user segment or campaign]
- **Listed Only:** [List integrations that don't need premium marketing treatment]
