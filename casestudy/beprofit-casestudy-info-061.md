### Navigation Patterns

- [ ] Mobile navigation adaptation

**Secondary Navigation:**
- [ ] Breadcrumbs present?
- [ ] "Related articles" sidebar/footer
- [ ] "Popular articles" section
- [ ] "Recently updated" visibility

**Article Navigation:**
- [ ] Table of contents for long articles
- [ ] "Was this helpful?" feedback mechanism
- [ ] Article rating system

### Categorization & Taxonomy

**Category Design:**
- [ ] How many top-level categories?
- [ ] Are categories user-task-oriented or product-feature-oriented?
  - User-task: "Setting up your store", "Tracking ad spend"
  - Product-feature: "Dashboard", "Integrations", "Reports"
- [ ] Consistent category naming conventions?
- [ ] Clear category descriptions?

**Tagging & Metadata:**

- [ ] Problem-type tags (e.g., "sync issues", "billing")?
- [ ] Difficulty level tags (beginner, advanced)?

### Cross-Linking Strategy

**Internal Linking:**
- [ ] Do articles link to related articles?
- [ ] Are links contextual (inline) or listed at end?
- [ ] "See also" sections present?
- [ ] Links to external resources (blog, community, product pages)?

**Link Density:**
- Low (few or no links) → Poor discoverability

- [ ] Search placeholder text
- [ ] Instant/autocomplete search?
- [ ] Search suggestions as you type?
- [ ] Search results page layout

- [ ] "No results" messaging and suggestions

**Search Quality:**
- [ ] Does search find relevant articles?
- [ ] Keyword vs semantic search?
- [ ] Does search work for common user queries?
  - Test: "refund", "ad spend not showing", "sync error"
- [ ] Search result snippet quality (does preview help?)

### Discoverability Patterns

**How Users Find Information:**

2. **Search** → Type query to find specific article
