## Relevance to Our Build

### Social Proof Strategy

**How many case studies do we need before launch vs post-launch?**
- **Pre-launch minimum:** 3-5 early customer case studies (even if customers are in beta)
- **Post-launch goal:** 10-20 case studies covering diverse industries, platforms, business sizes
- **Ongoing:** Add 1-2 new case studies per quarter to keep content fresh

**Should we create case study templates or hire professional writers?**
- **Templates:** Create internal template for gathering customer stories (questions to ask, structure)
- **DIY first:** Write first 3-5 case studies internally to establish voice and quality bar
- **Professional help:** Consider hiring case study writer after initial batch (scales better, maintains quality)
- **Video production:** Start with user-generated testimonial videos (authentic), upgrade to professional production later

**What metrics should we track and highlight in case studies?**
- **Primary metrics:** Time saved, profit increase, cost reduction (quantifiable)
- **Secondary metrics:** Number of stores managed, order volume, team size (context)
- **Qualitative outcomes:** Confidence, clarity, peace of mind (emotional connection)
- **Success formula:** Lead with quantitative (credibility) + support with qualitative (relatability)

### Testimonial Collection System

### Credibility Building
