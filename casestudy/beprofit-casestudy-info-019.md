## Customer Analytics Overview

BeProfit's customer analytics capabilities are centered around a **Cohort Analysis** feature, accessible under **Reports → Customer Life Time** in the left sidebar. The Help Center has only 2 articles in the "Customer Lifetime Value" category, suggesting this is a relatively focused feature set compared to the depth of product or marketing analytics.

The marketing site (beprofit.co) positions customer analytics under "Retention & LTV" with the tagline: "Discover the elements that build trust and their role in your profit growth."

### Where Customer Data Appears

Customer-related data surfaces in several locations across BeProfit:

| Location | Customer Feature | Details |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Reports → Customer Life Time** | Cohort Analysis chart | Primary customer analytics tool |
| **Dashboard header** | Customer segment filter | "All Customers" dropdown with New/Returning toggle |
| **P&L Report** | Customer segment comparison | Side-by-side P&L for New vs Returning customers |
| **Marketing Analytics** | CAC / CPA metrics | Customer acquisition cost calculations |
| **Marketing section** | BCAC metric | Blended Customer Acquisition Cost |
| **Orders page** | Marketing Source filter | Filter orders by acquisition channel |

## Cohort Analysis

### Navigation Path
**Reports → Customer Life Time** → Cohort Analysis Chart

### What Is Cohort Analysis?
"Cohort analysis is the process of grouping your customers based on specific criteria, such as the time period they made a purchase or the discount code they used." It enables tracking "the behavior of different cohorts over time, giving you a comprehensive understanding of your store's data."

### Cohort Definition
Cohorts are defined by the **time period of first purchase**. Customers are grouped by the week, month, or year they first bought from the store.

**Customer Cohort Column:** "Categorizes cohorts based on the week they made their first purchase (W01 - W06)" — each row in the chart represents a cohort defined by their acquisition week.

## Cohort Analysis Chart Configuration

### Configuration Options

| Control | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Date Picker** | Custom date range | Top-left, selects analysis time period |
| **Cohort Grouping** | Week, Month, Year | Granularity of cohort definition |
| **Column Limit** | Max 13 columns | Maximum columns displayed across date range |
| **Custom Filtering** | Various filters | Customize displayed cohort data |
| **Base Metric** | Sales, ROAS, Repurchase Rate, Gross Profit | Primary metric displayed in the chart |
| **Data Progression Mode** | Accumulated, Marginal | How metric values accumulate over time |
| **Calculation Scheme** | Average per Customer, Total Cohort | Per-customer average vs cohort total |

### Base Metric Options

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sales** | Revenue generated by the cohort over time |
| **ROAS** | Return on ad spend for the cohort |
| **Repurchase Rate** | Percentage of customers who purchase again |
| **Gross Profit** | Profit (Sales - COGS) generated by the cohort |

### Data Progression Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Accumulated** | "Cohort's accumulated metric value per period" — running total that grows over time | Understanding total lifetime value trajectory |
| **Marginal** | "Cohort's marginal metric value per period" — incremental value added in each period | Understanding when repeat purchases taper off |

### Calculation Schemes

| Scheme | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Average per Customer** | "Average metric value per customer in the cohort" | Understanding per-customer economics |
| **Total Cohort** | "Total metric value per cohort" | Understanding absolute cohort value |

## Cohort Chart Metrics

### Core Columns

| Column | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| **Customer Cohort** | Identifies the cohort (e.g., W01 through W06 for weekly grouping) |
| **New Customers** | Quantity of first-time purchasers in the cohort during the specified period |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | "Total marketing spend divided by the new customers in that cohort" |
| **Lifetime Value (LTV)** | "Average monetary value each customer in a cohort contributes over their lifetime" |
| **Weeks Since Cohort (0-6+)** | Time progression columns representing periods elapsed since initial purchase |

### CAC Formula
```
CAC = Total Marketing Spend / New Customers in Cohort
```

### LTV Metric
LTV represents the average monetary value each customer contributes over their relationship with the store. The exact formula is not specified in the Help Center, but based on the cohort structure it's likely:
```
LTV = Total Revenue from Cohort / Number of Customers in Cohort
```
When using "Average per Customer" calculation scheme, LTV shows per-customer values. When using "Total Cohort," it shows aggregate cohort value.

---

## Break-Even Indicator

A distinctive visual feature: **green triangles** mark the break-even point on the cohort chart.

**Definition:** "The estimated point in time at which the LTV matches the CAC for that respective cohort."

**Significance:**
- Before the triangle: cohort has not yet recovered its acquisition cost
- At the triangle: LTV = CAC (break-even)
- After the triangle: cohort is generating profit beyond acquisition cost

**Example:** If CAC for W01 cohort is $50 and LTV reaches $50 in Week 3, the green triangle appears at Week 3, indicating that on average, customers in this cohort pay for themselves by their third week.

This is a powerful visualization that directly answers: "How long does it take to recoup my marketing investment on a customer?"

---

## Cohort Analysis Example Pattern

The Help Center provides an example showing ROAS progression for a cohort:

**Cohort W01 ROAS:** 0.4 → 0.5 across consecutive weeks

This demonstrates:
- Initial ROAS is below 1.0 (spending more on acquisition than earning back immediately)
- ROAS improves over time as customers make repeat purchases
- The accumulated pattern shows the "payback curve" of marketing investment

## Customer Segmentation

### Dashboard-Level Segmentation
From file 011, the dashboard header includes an **"All Customers" dropdown** with a funnel icon enabling:

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **All Customers** | Default — includes everyone |
| **New Customers** | First-time buyers only |
| **Returning Customers** | Repeat purchasers only |

This filter applies **dashboard-wide**, controlling all sections simultaneously. This means merchants can instantly see:
- Revenue from new vs returning customers
- Profit contribution from each segment
- Marketing metrics per segment
- Product performance per segment

### P&L Segmentation
From file 012, the P&L report supports a toggle to "compare performance between customer segments" with a **side-by-side** view for New vs Returning customers.

### Cohort-Level Segmentation
Within the cohort analysis, customers are implicitly segmented by:
- **Acquisition period** — which week/month/year they first purchased
- **Discount code used** (mentioned as a cohort criteria option)
- **Custom filters** (available but not enumerated)

### Missing Segmentation Dimensions
Based on Help Center documentation, the following segmentation dimensions are NOT documented:
- By acquisition channel (Facebook, Google, organic, etc.)
- By geographic region
- By order value tier (high-value vs low-value)
- By product category purchased
- By engagement level (active, at-risk, churned)

---

## Repeat Purchase Tracking

### Cohort-Based Repeat Purchase
The **Repurchase Rate** is one of the four base metrics available in the cohort analysis chart. Combined with the time progression columns (Weeks Since Cohort 0-6+), this shows:
- What percentage of a cohort makes a second purchase
- When repeat purchases happen (which week/month after first purchase)
- How repeat purchase rates compare across cohorts

### Marginal vs Accumulated View
- **Accumulated Repurchase Rate:** Shows total % of customers who have repurchased by week N
- **Marginal Repurchase Rate:** Shows % of customers who repurchased specifically in week N (incremental)

### New vs Returning Dashboard Filter
The dashboard's customer segment filter (file 011) enables viewing all metrics filtered to "Returning Customers" only, providing:
- Revenue from repeat purchasers
- Profit from repeat purchasers
- Product preferences of returning customers (via product section)

## Data Model Implications

### Customer Entity Requirements
1. **Customer identification** — unique customer ID (from Shopify/platform)
2. **First purchase date** — defines cohort membership
3. **Customer type classification** — New vs Returning per order
4. **Order history** — all orders linked to customer for LTV calculation
5. **Acquisition source** — marketing channel that acquired the customer (for CAC calculation)

### Cohort Aggregation Engine
1. **Cohort definition** — group customers by first purchase period (week/month/year)
2. **Time progression calculation** — metrics computed for each period since first purchase
3. **Break-even calculation** — compare accumulated LTV against cohort CAC
4. **Multi-metric support** — same cohort structure, different base metrics (Sales, ROAS, Repurchase Rate, Gross Profit)
5. **Dual accumulation** — support both accumulated (running total) and marginal (incremental) views

### Key Relationships
```
Customer (1) ──→ (N) Orders
Customer (1) ──→ (1) Cohort (based on first purchase date)
Customer (1) ──→ (1) AcquisitionSource (marketing channel)
Cohort (1) ──→ (N) Customers
Cohort (1) ──→ (N) TimePeriodMetrics (week 0, week 1, ... week N)
```

## Limitations & Gaps

1. **Only 2 Help Center articles.** The Customer Lifetime Value category is one of the smallest in the Help Center, suggesting either limited documentation or a simpler feature set compared to Products or Marketing Analytics.

2. **No individual customer view.** There's no documented per-customer detail page showing a single customer's order history, LTV, profitability, and behavior patterns.

3. **Limited segmentation dimensions.** Cohorts are primarily defined by acquisition time period. There's no documented support for segmenting by acquisition channel, product purchased, geographic region, or spending tier.

4. **LTV formula not explicitly documented.** While LTV appears as a metric, the exact calculation formula (revenue-based vs profit-based, time horizon, discount rate) is not specified.

5. **No churn or retention rate metrics.** Beyond Repurchase Rate in the cohort chart, there's no documented churn rate, retention curve, or at-risk customer identification.

6. **No customer-level marketing attribution.** Attribution is documented at the order level (file 017) but not at the customer level — i.e., "how much did it cost to acquire this specific customer across their entire journey?"

7. **Column limit of 13.** The cohort chart displays a maximum of 13 columns across the date range, which may limit analysis for longer time horizons or more granular views.

8. **Discount code as cohort criteria mentioned but not detailed.** The overview article mentions discount codes as a grouping criterion, but the chart guide focuses on time-based cohorts only. How discount-code-based cohorts work is undocumented.

9. **No RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.** A standard customer analytics framework, RFM analysis is not documented anywhere in BeProfit's Help Center.

10. **Marketing site provides minimal customer analytics detail.** The beprofit.co marketing site mentions "Retention & LTV" as a feature but provides no screenshots, detailed descriptions, or specific capabilities beyond the headline.

## Relevance to Our Build

1. **Cohort analysis with break-even visualization is a strong pattern.** The green triangle showing when LTV exceeds CAC is immediately actionable — it answers "when do customers become profitable?" We should implement this and make it prominent.

2. **Four base metrics (Sales, ROAS, Repurchase Rate, Gross Profit) cover key use cases.** These metrics answer different questions: "How much revenue do cohorts generate?" (Sales), "Is my marketing paying off?" (ROAS), "Are customers coming back?" (Repurchase Rate), "Am I actually profitable?" (Gross Profit). We should support all four and add Net Profit.

3. **Accumulated vs Marginal toggle is analytically valuable.** The two views answer different questions: "What's the total value by now?" vs "What's the incremental value this period?" This dual view should be a core feature of our cohort analysis.

4. **Build per-customer detail views that BeProfit lacks.** A significant gap: individual customer pages showing order history, LTV trajectory, acquisition cost, product preferences, and predicted future value would differentiate our product.

5. **Extend segmentation beyond time-based cohorts.** We should support cohorts by: acquisition channel, first product purchased, geographic region, discount code used, spending tier, and custom criteria. This dramatically increases the analytical power.

6. **Add RFM analysis.** Recency/Frequency/Monetary analysis is a standard e-commerce analytics technique that BeProfit doesn't offer. Implementing automatic RFM scoring and segmentation would be a differentiator.

7. **Build churn prediction.** BeProfit shows when customers repurchase but doesn't predict when they'll stop. A simple churn model based on purchase frequency would be valuable for retention campaigns.

8. **Integrate customer analytics with marketing.** BeProfit's customer analytics (cohort chart) and marketing analytics (ad spend tracking) appear somewhat siloed. We should deeply integrate them — e.g., "Show me cohort LTV for customers acquired via Facebook vs Google."

9. **Dashboard customer filter is powerful — extend it.** BeProfit's "All Customers / New / Returning" filter affects the entire dashboard. We should extend this with custom segments: high-value, at-risk, churned, first-purchase-this-month, etc.

10. **LTV prediction vs historical LTV.** BeProfit shows historical LTV (what customers have spent). We should also show predicted LTV based on cohort behavior patterns, giving merchants a forward-looking view.
