    ↓
    ├→ FILE 117 (Most Praised Features) - synthesizes positive sentiment from 111-116
    ├→ FILE 118 (Most Criticized Features) - synthesizes negative sentiment from 111-116
    ├→ FILE 119 (Feature Requests) - aggregates requests from 111-116
    ├→ FILE 120 (Churn & Support) - extracts churn mentions from 111-116
    └→ FILE 121 (Pricing Sentiment) - aggregates pricing feedback from 111-116
```

**Dependency Validation:**

For each synthesis file, verify it references the correct source files:

| Synthesis File | Expected Source Files | Actually References | Valid? |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 117 | 111-116 | [Check file 117] | [✓ / ✗] |
| 118 | 111-116 | [Check file 118] | [✓ / ✗] |
| 119 | 111-116 | [Check file 119] | [✓ / ✗] |
| 120 | 111-116 | [Check file 120] | [✓ / ✗] |
