**Current State of Files:**

- **Action required:** Populate with actual BeProfit.co data using `agent-browser` to navigate site, capture screenshots, document exact copy, and complete all sections

- **Action required:** Complete remaining sections - identify which sections are missing, gather data, fill placeholders

**Files Fully Populated:**
- [List file numbers and names that have all sections completed with real data, no "[to be filled]" placeholders]
- **Action required:** Quality review (verify accuracy, check links, ensure "Relevance to Our Build" is thoughtful) and final polish (formatting, consistency)

**Transition Plan:**

**If files are still mostly templates:**
- [ ] **Blocking:** Cannot proceed to PRD Part 07 until research phase is executed
- [ ] **Next step:** Use `agent-browser` skill to systematically visit BeProfit.co, navigate all pages documented in file inventory, capture data, populate templates
- [ ] **Timeline:** [Estimate time required for manual research - e.g., "2-4 hours per file, 28-56 hours total for 14 files"]
- [ ] **Priority:** [Which files to populate first - recommend starting with pricing, features, integrations as most critical]

**If files are partially complete:**
- [ ] **Decision:** Assess if partial data is sufficient for synthesis or if completion is required
- [ ] **Next step:** Prioritize completion of critical files (pricing, features) before moving to PRD Part 07
- [ ] **Timeline:** [Estimate time to complete partial files]

**If files are fully populated:**
- [ ] **Ready to proceed:** PRD Part 07 (Blog & Content Strategy)
- [ ] **Next step:** Begin PRD Part 07 research template creation and population
- [ ] **Synthesis:** Can begin synthesizing insights from PRD Part 06 into strategic recommendations

**Tool Usage Recommendations:**

  - Use `copywriting` skill for qualitative copy analysis (don't just copy-paste, analyze messaging strategy)
  - Use `seo-audit` for technical SEO (not just visible content but meta tags, schema, structured data)
  - Use `marketing-psychology` for persuasion tactics (identify specific tactics: scarcity, social proof, authority)
- [For future PRD parts:]
  - Establish tool usage pattern (e.g., always use `agent-browser` first for data gathering, then analytical skills)
  - Document which tools work best for which file types (e.g., `frontend-design` excellent for UI-heavy pages)
