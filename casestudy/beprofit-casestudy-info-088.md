### 2. Decoy Effect & Tier Positioning

**Mental Models Applied:** Decoy Effect, Asymmetric Dominance, Goldilocks Effect

#### Decoy Plan Identification

**Potential Decoy Plan Analysis:**

|------|-------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| [Starter] | $X | [Feature/limit] | [Feature/limit] | [Feature/limit] | [Drive to next tier?] |
| [Pro] | $Y | [Feature/limit] | [Feature/limit] | [Feature/limit] | [Most Popular - target plan?] |
| [Enterprise] | $Z or Contact | [Feature/limit] | [Feature/limit] | [Feature/limit] | [Anchor or actual target?] |

**Decoy Characteristics to Look For:**
