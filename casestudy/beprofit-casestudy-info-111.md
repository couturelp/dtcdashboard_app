## Relevance to Our Build

### Strategic Insights for DTC Dashboard
Based on Shopify App Store review analysis, identify:

**What Users Love (Replicate):**
- [x] Top 3 most praised features to ensure our dashboard includes:
  1. **Accurate profit calculation with comprehensive detail**: Users consistently praise the accuracy. Our dashboard MUST have rock-solid profit math accounting for all cost dimensions (COGS, shipping, discounts, marketplace fees, ad spend, transaction fees, returns).
  2. **Multi-store management with unified dashboard**: BeProfit's multi-shop view is a key differentiator. Our dashboard should support multiple stores/brands with consolidated and per-store views from day one.
  3. **Real-time profit insights**: Users value seeing profit data update in real-time, not batch-processed overnight. Our architecture must support real-time data refresh.

**What Users Hate (Avoid):**
- [x] Top 3 pain points to avoid in our implementation:
  1. **Ad spend attribution bugs**: CRITICAL - BeProfit's Google Ads issue (only tracking UTM-attributed spend) is a deal-breaker bug that makes profit calculations misleading. Our ad spend tracking MUST capture 100% of actual spend from connected ad accounts, not just attributed spend. This is non-negotiable.
  2. **Pricing accessibility for small stores**: $49/month entry point is criticized as "expensive" for small stores. Our pricing strategy should consider a more accessible entry tier or more generous order limits at lower price points.
  3. **Calculation errors and configuration issues**: "Calculation Preferences section not working properly" suggests UX/reliability issues. Our settings and configuration must be bulletproof with validation and error handling.

**Feature Gaps (Opportunity):**
- [x] Top 3 requested features that could be competitive advantages:
  1. **Complete ad spend tracking for Performance Max campaigns**: BeProfit fails here. If we can properly track Google Performance Max and feed-based campaigns (full spend, not just attributed), this becomes a major competitive advantage.
  2. **Better LTV cohort analysis**: Users mention "minor improvements needed" suggesting current LTV features are good but not great. We can differentiate with more sophisticated customer lifetime value modeling.
  3. **Transparent, clear pricing and refund policies**: Complaints about "rudely declined refunds" and lack of policy transparency suggest an opportunity to build trust with clear, customer-friendly policies.

**UX Lessons:**
- [x] UX patterns that users praise: "Intuitive analytics dashboard", "easy to see true earnings in one dashboard", multi-shop view that "merges" stores, clean visual layout (evident from screenshots)
- [x] UX frustrations to avoid: "Calculation Preferences section not working properly" suggests confusing settings UI. Must have clear, testable configuration with inline validation.

**Support & Onboarding:**
- [x] Support quality expectations: Users expect "10/10" support, "exceptional 1-on-1" assistance, responsiveness. BeProfit sets high bar with personal onboarding (Anthony mentioned by name). We should match or exceed this with responsive, helpful, personalized support.
- [x] Onboarding challenges: No explicit onboarding complaints, but "3 days usage" reviews suggest quick time-to-value. Setup should be simple enough for merchants to see accurate profit data within first few days.

**Pricing Psychology:**
- [x] Price sensitivity: Small stores find $49/mo "expensive". Sweet spot appears to be $29-39/mo for entry tier or higher order limits at $49/mo. Annual discount (20%) is well-received.
- [x] Value perception: Users justify cost when profit accuracy is proven, support is excellent, and multi-store features save time. Value = (accurate data + time saved + actionable insights) > monthly cost.

**Integration Requirements:**
- [x] Critical integrations mentioned: Google Ads (MUST WORK PROPERLY - this is where BeProfit fails), Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, Shopify (baseline), Amazon (supported). Multi-platform ad tracking is table stakes.
- [x] Integration pain points: Google Ads Performance Max attribution is broken in BeProfit. We must solve full ad spend import, not just UTM-tracked spend. This is a critical differentiator opportunity.

**Target User Personas:**
- [x] Primary user type: Established e-commerce stores (1-3+ years in business), multi-store operators, international sellers with cross-market operations, stores with significant ad spend (need accurate ROAS). These users leave detailed, technical reviews.
- [x] Underserved segments: Small/new stores (<$5k/mo revenue) find pricing prohibitive. Google Ads-heavy stores (especially Performance Max users) are underserved due to attribution bug. Both segments are opportunities.
