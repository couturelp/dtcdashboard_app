---

## Gaps & Missing Information

### Known Limitations
**Automated Execution Constraint:**
All files 051-062 are RESEARCH TEMPLATES created without direct access to BeProfit's help center (https://help.runviably.com/beprofit). These templates document:
- Expected content structure
- Research questions to answer
- Checklists for systematic exploration

**Next Step Required:**
Manual help center research pass to populate templates with actual BeProfit content. This can be done using:
- `agent-browser` skill for automated browsing and extraction
- Manual browsing and note-taking
- Web scraping tools with permission

### Missing Content Areas (To Be Filled After Manual Research)
- [ ] Specific help article titles and URLs not yet captured
- [ ] Exact BeProfit terminology and phrasing not yet documented
- [ ] Screenshots and visual elements not yet collected
- [ ] Live calculation examples not yet captured
- [ ] Real troubleshooting scenarios from actual articles not yet documented
