4. **Proof (Social proof, testimonials):** [where does it build trust?]
5. **Explanation (Features, benefits, how it works):** [where does it educate?]
6. **Objection Handling:** [where does it address concerns?]
7. **Urgency/Scarcity:** [where does it create reason to act now?]
8. **Final CTA:** [where does it ask for conversion?]

**Narrative Effectiveness:**

- Is there a clear progression toward conversion?

**CTA Count:** [how many times is user asked to take action?]

**Content Balance:**
- Too much text (overwhelming) ← → Just right ← → Too little text (unclear)
- Too many sections (overwhelming) ← → Just right ← → Too few sections (not enough info)

**Trust Signal Density:**

### CTA Placement Strategy

Document EVERY CTA on the homepage:
1. **Hero CTA:** [text + link destination]
2. **Section 2 CTA:** [text + link destination]
3. **Section 3 CTA:** [text + link destination]
(list all CTAs from top to bottom)

**CTA Strategy Analysis:**
- How often does the user encounter a CTA? (every section, every other section, sparse)
- Are CTAs consistent ("Start free trial" repeated) or varied?
- Do CTAs match the section context (e.g., "See integrations" in integrations section)?
- Is there a primary CTA (always same action) or multiple paths?

### Conversion Optimization Patterns

**Techniques Observed:**
- [ ] Urgency ("Limited time", "Join today")
- [ ] Scarcity ("Only X spots left", "Popular plan")
- [ ] Social proof ("10,000 customers can't be wrong")
- [ ] Authority ("Recommended by experts", "Shopify Partner")
- [ ] Reciprocity ("Free trial", "Free tool")
- [ ] Guarantee / Risk reversal ("30-day money back")
- [ ] Anchoring (pricing comparison)
- [ ] FOMO (fear of missing out)
- [ ] Clarity (extremely clear what happens next)

### Objection Handling

**Common Objections & Where They're Addressed:**
- "Is it expensive?" → [pricing teaser, free trial mentioned]
- "Is it hard to set up?" → [how it works section, "Set up in 5 minutes"]
- "Will it work with my store?" → [integrations section, platform logos]
- "Can I trust this?" → [testimonials, brand logos, reviews]
- "What if I don't like it?" → [free trial, guarantee]

**Objection Handling Quality:**
- Are major objections addressed proactively?
- Are objections addressed with proof (not just claims)?

### Mobile Responsiveness Notes

### Comparison to Help Center Messaging

**Marketing Claims vs Product Reality:**
Compare homepage marketing claims to what help center documentation shows:

- Claim: [e.g., "Set up in 5 minutes"]
  - Help center reality: [is setup actually that fast based on docs?]
- Claim: [e.g., "Supports 50+ integrations"]
  - Help center reality: [how many integrations actually documented?]
- Claim: [e.g., "Real-time profit tracking"]
  - Help center reality: [is sync actually real-time or delayed?]

**Honesty Assessment:**
- Do marketing claims match product capabilities?
- Are there exaggerations or misleading statements?
- Is the product undersold or oversold?
