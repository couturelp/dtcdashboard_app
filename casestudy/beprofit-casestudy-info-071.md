## Source
- **Primary URL:** https://beprofit.co/
- **Category:** Marketing Website / Homepage / Hero Section
- **Date Captured:** 2026-02-13
- **Research Status:** ⚠️ TEMPLATE - Requires manual website research

## Research Objective
Document the hero section (headline, subheadline, CTA, imagery), capture above-the-fold content for first impression analysis, use `copywriting` skill to analyze messaging effectiveness, and note immediate social proof elements.

## Section Structure:

### Hero Section Components
- [ ] Main headline (exact text)
- [ ] Subheadline / supporting copy (exact text)
- [ ] Primary CTA button (text, color, placement)
- [ ] Secondary CTA (if exists)
- [ ] Hero image / video / illustration
- [ ] Background design (solid color, gradient, pattern, photo)

**Analysis Questions:**
- Does the headline clearly state what BeProfit does?
- Is the value proposition immediately clear?
- Does the headline speak to user pain points or desired outcomes?
- How action-oriented is the CTA?
- Does the hero visual support the message or distract?

### Above-the-Fold Content (What's Visible Without Scrolling)
- [ ] Logo and navigation bar
- [ ] Hero section (headline, CTA, visual)
- [ ] Trust badges or logos (e.g., "Trusted by 10,000+ stores")
- [ ] Social proof numbers (e.g., "Join 5,000 sellers")
- [ ] Any additional content visible immediately

**First Impression Assessment:**
- What is the FIRST message the user sees?
- How quickly can a user understand what BeProfit does?
- Is there enough information to click the CTA?
- What emotion does the above-the-fold section evoke? (trust, urgency, curiosity, confusion)

### Headline Analysis (Copywriting Skill)
**Headline:** [To be filled with actual headline]

**Copywriting Framework Analysis:**
- [ ] Clarity: Is it immediately clear what this product does?
  - Score: [1-10]
  - Notes: [specific observations]
- [ ] Specificity: Does it use concrete language vs abstract claims?
  - Examples: "Track profit in real-time" (specific) vs "Get insights" (vague)
- [ ] Value: Does it communicate a benefit or outcome?
  - User outcome: [what the user gets]
- [ ] Emotion: Does it tap into user pain or desire?
  - Pain addressed: [e.g., "not knowing true profitability"]
  - Desire tapped: [e.g., "making data-driven decisions"]
- [ ] Uniqueness: Does it differentiate from competitors?
  - Differentiation: [how it stands out]

**Common Headline Patterns in Profit Analytics:**
- Pattern 1: "[Action] your [desired outcome]" → e.g., "Maximize your Shopify profits"
- Pattern 2: "The [solution] for [target audience]" → e.g., "The profit dashboard for e-commerce sellers"
- Pattern 3: "[Outcome] in [timeframe/simplicity]" → e.g., "Know your real profit in seconds"
- Pattern 4: Problem → Solution → "Finally, [outcome]" → e.g., "Finally, a dashboard that shows actual profit"

### Subheadline / Supporting Copy Analysis
**Subheadline:** [To be filled]

**Purpose:**
- [ ] Elaborates on headline
- [ ] Addresses objections
- [ ] Adds specificity
- [ ] Calls out target audience
- [ ] Mentions key features/benefits

**Effectiveness:**
- Does it complement the headline or just repeat it?
- Does it provide enough detail to clarify the value?
- Is it concise or too wordy?

### Primary CTA Analysis
**CTA Text:** [e.g., "Start Free Trial", "Get Started", "See Your Profit"]
**CTA Design:**
- Button color: [color hex or description]
- Button size: [small/medium/large/very large]
- Button placement: [center, left, right]
- Surrounding white space: [cramped/spacious]

**CTA Effectiveness:**
- [ ] Action-oriented language (starts with verb)
- [ ] Low friction (e.g., "Start free" vs "Buy now")
- [ ] Clear outcome (user knows what happens next)
- [ ] High contrast (stands out visually)
- [ ] Appropriately sized (easy to click)

**CTA Psychology:**
- Does the CTA create urgency? (e.g., "Start now", "Limited time")
- Does it reduce risk? (e.g., "Free trial", "No credit card")
- Does it promise value? (e.g., "See your profit", not just "Sign up")

### Hero Visual Analysis
**Visual Type:** [photo, illustration, screenshot, video, animation, 3D render]
**Visual Subject:** [dashboard screenshot, happy customer, abstract concept, product in use]

**Visual Effectiveness:**
- [ ] Shows the product in use (screenshot of dashboard)
- [ ] Shows happy customers using product
- [ ] Abstract concept/metaphor
- [ ] Just decorative

**Questions:**
- Does the visual help explain what BeProfit does?
- Does it show proof (real screenshots) or just vibes?
- Is there a clear focal point or is it cluttered?
- Does it appeal to the target audience aesthetically?

### Social Proof Above the Fold
- [ ] Customer count ("10,000+ stores trust BeProfit")
- [ ] Review score/stars ("4.8/5 stars on Shopify App Store")
- [ ] Brand logos ("Used by [Brand X, Brand Y, Brand Z]")
- [ ] Awards/certifications ("Shopify Partner", "SOC 2 Certified")
- [ ] None visible above the fold

**Social Proof Placement:**
- Integrated into hero section
- Separate strip below hero
- Part of headline/subheadline copy
- Badge/logo display

**Social Proof Analysis:**
- Is the proof credible and verifiable?
- Does the number feel impressive or just okay? (10,000 stores vs 100 stores)
- Are brand logos recognizable or obscure?
- Is the proof recent or outdated?
