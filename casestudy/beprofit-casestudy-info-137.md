## Executive Summary

BeProfit, legally operating as "Become Technological Solutions LTD," represents an Israeli fintech-to-SaaS pivot story that successfully transitioned from business lending to e-commerce analytics. Founded in 2016 in Tel Aviv and pivoting to the BeProfit product in 2020, the company raised $18.7M in total funding before being acquired by Viably in October 2024 for an undisclosed amount. The company was led by four co-founders: Eden Amirav (CEO, Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree and serial entrepreneur since age 16), Uri Sittan (CTO, former SAP QA Manager with e-commerce tech background), Daniel Katz (COO), and Ofer Ariel. At the time of acquisition, BeProfit employed 28 team members and served thousands of Shopify, WooCommerce, and Amazon sellers with its profit tracking SaaS platform.

The acquisition by Viably—a venture-backed e-commerce fintech platform providing funding and banking solutions—marks a strategic vertical integration where Viably gains profit analytics capabilities to complement its capital provisioning services (Viably had raised $71-74.8M and secured a $50M debt facility from Viola Credit). This consolidation reflects broader market trends toward integrated e-commerce financial platforms that combine banking, funding, and analytics in a single offering. BeProfit's corporate trajectory illustrates the challenges of competing in a crowded Shopify app ecosystem (11,905+ apps) while demonstrating that specialized SaaS tools with strong product-market fit can achieve successful exits even in highly competitive markets.

## Company Timeline

- **Original Product:** Become.co - SMB lending platform using algorithms to match small businesses with customized funding offers
- **Former Names:** "Become" and "Lending Express" (aliases before pivoting)

### BeProfit → Viably Connection

**Acquisition Details:**

**Acquirer: Viably**
- **Founded:** 2021
- **Headquarters:** Cary, North Carolina, USA
- **Founder/CEO:** Doron Gordon
- **Business Model:** E-commerce financial technology platform providing funding, banking solutions, and financial management tools
- **Platform Evolution:** Originally provided direct funding; as of 2026, operates as AI-powered marketplace matching e-commerce sellers with 100+ capital providers
- **Target Customers:** Amazon, Shopify, and wholesale e-commerce sellers

**Strategic Rationale for Acquisition:**

1. **Vertical Integration:**
   - Viably: Capital provision (funding, banking)
   - BeProfit: Profit analytics and financial visibility
   - Combined value proposition: "Fund businesses based on actual profit data, not just revenue"

2. **Customer Base Expansion:**
   - BeProfit brought thousands of Shopify/WooCommerce merchants
   - Viably gains access to merchants who may need capital (profit analytics reveals cash flow gaps)
   - Cross-sell opportunity: Analytics users → funding customers

3. **Product Differentiation:**
   - Competitors (Shopify Capital, Clearco, Wayflyer) lack integrated profit analytics
   - Unified platform: "Manage and grow in a single platform—integrating funding, payments, and financial planning across markets, products, and currencies"

4. **Data Advantage:**
   - BeProfit's historical profit data informs better underwriting decisions
   - Merchants with clean financial data = lower default risk = better lending terms

**Post-Acquisition Status:**
- BeProfit legal entity: **Inactive** (absorbed into Viably)
- Product: Likely rebranded as "Viably Analytics" or integrated feature within Viably platform
- Team: 28 BeProfit employees presumably integrated into Viably operations (specific retention details not publicly disclosed)
- Brand: BeProfit.co domain may redirect to Viably or maintain separate presence for SEO purposes

**Comparable Acquisitions (Market Context):**
- Lifetimely acquired by AMP (parent company consolidation in e-commerce analytics)
- Clearco (formerly Clearbanc) raised $485M+ to combine funding + analytics
- Trend: E-commerce financial infrastructure consolidating toward all-in-one platforms

## Funding History

### Funding Overview

**Total Capital Raised: $18.7 Million**
(BeProfit/Become Technological Solutions prior to Viably acquisition)

**Funding Structure:**
- Multiple rounds raised between 2016-2024 (specific round breakdowns not fully disclosed in public sources)
- Known investor: **Gordon Brothers** (participated in Series A round)
- Additional investors not publicly disclosed in accessible databases (Crunchbase profile requires subscription for detailed round data)

**Funding Trajectory Implications:**
- $18.7M is moderate-scale SaaS funding (Series A/B range)
- Suggests company was post-product-market-fit but pre-scale (not yet at $50M+ Series C stage)
- Acquisition timing (2024) indicates either:
  - Strong acquisition opportunity aligned with strategic goals (soft landing), OR
  - Capital efficiency challenges requiring exit before next funding round

### Viably Funding (Acquirer Context)

Since BeProfit is now part of Viably, understanding Viably's financial strength is relevant:

**Total Equity Raised: $71-74.8 Million**
(Reported amounts vary by source: CB Insights reports $71M, PitchBook reports $74.8M)

**Known Investors:**
- **Viola Ventures** (Israeli VC firm)
- **Viola Credit** (debt financing arm)
- **Salesforce Ventures** (strategic investor)
- **Angular Ventures**
- **Anamcara Capital**
- **Bull City Venture Partners**
- **Triangle Tweener Fund**

**Debt Financing:**
- **$50 Million debt facility** from Viola Credit (November 2023)
- Purpose: "Viably Wholesaler Accelerator" product (capital for e-commerce wholesalers)

**Strategic Funding Significance:**
- $71-74.8M equity + $50M debt = $121-125M total capital access
- Viably's financial strength enabled BeProfit acquisition (cash and/or stock deal)
- Well-capitalized acquirer increases likelihood of BeProfit product investment (not acqui-hire for talent shutdown)

### Total Funding Raised

**BeProfit Standalone:**
- $18.7M (2016-2024)

**Post-Acquisition (Viably Entity):**
- $18.7M (BeProfit historical) + $71-74.8M (Viably equity) + $50M (Viably debt) = $139.7-143.5M combined capital

**Funding Insights:**
- BeProfit's $18.7M was sufficient to build Shopify App Store top analytics product but not enough to dominate category alone
- Viably's $121-125M capital base provides resources to scale BeProfit product within integrated platform
- Acquisition likely more capital-efficient than BeProfit raising Series B/C independently in competitive market

### Valuation (Estimated)

**BeProfit Acquisition Price:**
- **Not publicly disclosed**
- Typical SaaS acquisition multiples: 5-10x ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
- Estimated BeProfit ARR (reverse engineering):
  - If 5,000 paying customers at average $80/month = $4.8M ARR
  - If 10,000 paying customers at average $70/month = $8.4M ARR
- Implied valuation range: **$24M - $84M** (assuming 5-10x ARR multiple)
- Note: This is speculative; actual acquisition price could be higher/lower based on strategic premium, earn-out structure, stock vs cash mix

**Viably Valuation:**
- Not publicly disclosed (private company)
- Last funding round valuation not accessible without PitchBook/Crunchbase premium subscription

- 2024 (Acquisition): 28 employees frozen at acquisition date
- **Growth rate:** ~2-3x team size during product pivot and SaaS scaling (2020-2024)

### Hiring Signals

**Pre-Acquisition Hiring Activity (2023-2024):**
Specific job postings not captured in search results, but typical hiring patterns for company at this stage would include:
- **Engineering:** Full-stack developers, data engineers (for analytics infrastructure)
- **Product:** Product managers for feature expansion
- **Customer Success:** Support engineers, success managers (as customer base grew)
- **Marketing:** Content marketers, growth marketers (Shopify app ecosystem competition)

**Post-Acquisition Hiring (Viably Context):**
- BeProfit team absorption into Viably (28 employees integrated)

**Strategic Hiring Implications:**
- Small team (28) for product scale suggests:
  - High efficiency (low burn rate)
  - Focused product scope (profit analytics only, not expanding to inventory management, CRM, etc.)
  - Technical debt possible (small engineering team supporting growing customer base)
- Acquisition timing suggests team size hitting operational limits (needed capital/resources to scale further)

## Strategic Pivots & Direction Changes

### Pivot 1: Lending Marketplace → E-commerce SaaS (2020)

**Original Business Model (2016-2020):**
- **Product:** Become.co - Lending marketplace
- **Value Proposition:** Match SMBs with customized funding offers using algorithms
- **Revenue Model:** Likely referral fees from lenders (typical marketplace economics)
- **Target Customer:** General SMBs seeking capital

**New Business Model (2020-2024):**
- **Product:** BeProfit - Profit analytics SaaS
- **Value Proposition:** Real-time profit tracking, automated cost reconciliation
- **Revenue Model:** SaaS subscriptions ($29-199+/month tiered pricing)
- **Target Customer:** E-commerce merchants (Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon sellers)

**Pivot Drivers:**

1. **Product-Market Fit Discovery:**
   - Observation: SMBs seeking loans often didn't know their actual profitability
   - Problem: "You can't manage what you don't measure" - merchants needed profit visibility BEFORE seeking capital
   - Insight: Analytics product more valuable than lending referrals

2. **Market Opportunity:**
   - E-commerce explosion (Shopify GMV growth: $235.9B in 2023 → $292.3B in 2024)
   - Shopify App Store as distribution channel (11,905 apps, but profit analytics category still emerging in 2020)
   - Recurring revenue model superior to one-time lending referrals

3. **Competitive Landscape:**
   - Lending marketplace crowded (Clearco, Shopify Capital, Wayflyer, dozens of others)
   - Profit analytics less saturated in 2020 (TrueProfit, Lifetimely existing but category nascent)
   - Defensibility: Historical data creates switching costs (network effect of data)

4. **Founder Expertise:**
   - Deep financial analysis knowledge from lending business
   - Understanding of SMB financial pain points
   - Technical capability to build integrations (Uri Sittan's SAP/UPS background)

**Pivot Execution:**
- Soft launch: November 2020 (Shopify App)
- Brand evolution: "Become" brand faded, "BeProfit" became primary
- Customer migration: Unclear if Become lending customers transitioned to BeProfit (likely small overlap)
- Team restructuring: Pivot required hiring e-commerce expertise, likely some lending-focused employees departed

**Pivot Success Metrics:**
- Achieved sufficient scale to attract $18.7M funding
- Built product compelling enough for Viably acquisition
- Survived 4 years (2020-2024) in highly competitive Shopify app market
- **Verdict: Successful pivot** (exited via acquisition, not failure/shutdown)

### Pivot 2: Software-Only → Software + Services (2023)

**Strategic Shift: Wise Advice Partnership**

**Original Model:**
- Pure SaaS: Sell software subscription, merchants use self-service
- Support: Email/chat support for technical issues
- Services: None (merchants hire own accountants/CFOs separately)

**Expanded Model (2023):**
- SaaS + Professional Services: Software remains core, but partner offers CFO services
- Value Proposition: "Profit analytics data + expert financial guidance = better outcomes"
- Revenue Model: Likely referral fees from Wise Advice (or Wise Advice paid licensing fee for BeProfit access)

**Strategic Rationale:**

1. **Customer Success Enhancement:**
   - Data alone insufficient for many merchants (need interpretation, strategy)
   - CFO services address "Now what?" question after seeing profit dashboard
   - Higher customer LTV: Services engagement reduces churn (customers more committed)

2. **Market Positioning:**
   - Differentiation vs pure-software competitors (TrueProfit, Lifetimely don't offer CFO pairing)
   - Premium positioning: "Enterprise-grade financial management for SMBs"

3. **Economic Context:**
   - 2023 economic recession: Merchants needed cost optimization help
   - Services partnership timely: "Survive recession by optimizing profit"

4. **Distribution Expansion:**
   - Wise Advice refers accounting clients to BeProfit (new customer acquisition channel)
   - BeProfit refers software customers to Wise Advice (monetize customer base beyond software)

**Execution Challenges (Speculative):**
- Services don't scale like software (CFO hours required per customer)
- Partnership dependency: Wise Advice capacity limits growth (can't serve 10,000 customers)
- Geographic limitation: Wise Advice based in New Zealand (time zone, market reach challenges)

**Outcome:**
- Partnership announced May 2023
- Viably acquisition October 2024 (15 months later)
- **Verdict: Unclear impact** - too short timeframe to assess long-term success, but signals BeProfit exploring growth vectors beyond pure software

### Direction Changes (Corporate Strategy Evolution)

**2016-2020: Fintech Infrastructure Focus**
- Build lending marketplace
- Target general SMBs
- Revenue model: Referral/marketplace fees

**2020-2023: Vertical SaaS Focus**
- Build e-commerce analytics tool
- Target Shopify/WooCommerce merchants
- Revenue model: SaaS subscriptions

**2023-2024: Platform + Services Hybrid**
- Maintain SaaS product
- Add professional services layer (Wise Advice partnership)
- Revenue model: SaaS + referral/service fees

**2024-Present: Integrated Fintech Platform (Post-Viably Acquisition)**
- BeProfit absorbed into Viably platform
- Analytics + Funding + Banking unified offering
- Revenue model: SaaS + lending revenue share + banking fees

**Strategic Arc:**
The company's evolution shows consistent theme: **Solving SMB/e-commerce financial complexity**
- Version 1.0: Help find capital (lending marketplace)
- Version 2.0: Help understand profitability (analytics SaaS)
- Version 3.0: Help optimize finances (software + CFO services)
- Version 4.0: Integrate entire financial stack (Viably platform)

Each iteration moved "up the value chain" toward more comprehensive financial management solution.

## Relevance to Our Build

### Corporate Trajectory Insights

**Lesson 1: Pivot Timing**
- BeProfit pivoted from lending to analytics in 2020 (early COVID e-commerce boom)
- **Implication:** Market timing matters - entering e-commerce analytics during surge gave BeProfit tailwind
- **Our Strategy:** 2026 market still growing (14-15% CAGR) - window remains open but closing as market matures

**Lesson 2: Acquisition as Outcome**
- $18.7M funding → $24-84M acquisition (estimated) = successful outcome but not unicorn
- **Implication:** Realistic exit path is strategic acquisition by larger fintech/commerce platform, not IPO
- **Our Strategy:** Build with acquisition thesis in mind (potential acquirers: Shopify, Intuit, Square, Stripe, fintech roll-ups)

**Lesson 3: Small Team Viability**
- 28 employees served thousands of customers (high efficiency)
- **Implication:** Can build defensible product without raising $50M+ and hiring hundreds
- **Our Strategy:** Stay lean, optimize for capital efficiency, focus on product quality over team size

**Lesson 4: Services Partnerships**
- Wise Advice collaboration shows software-only may have LTV ceiling
- **Implication:** Professional services layer increases customer stickiness and willingness to pay
- **Our Strategy:** Consider partnerships with e-commerce agencies, fractional CFO networks, accounting firms

**Lesson 5: Corporate Complexity**
- Name changes (Become → BeProfit), aliases (Lending Express), pivots create brand confusion
- **Implication:** Clean, consistent branding easier to market and sell
- **Our Strategy:** Launch with clear brand identity, avoid pivots that require full rebrand

### Competitive Intelligence

**BeProfit's Strengths (Pre-Acquisition):**
- Israeli engineering talent (technical quality)
- Fintech expertise (deep financial domain knowledge)
- Multi-platform support (Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon)
- Integration breadth (50+ integrations)

**BeProfit's Weaknesses (Inferred):**
- Small team (28) vs larger competitors (TrueProfit, Lifetimely potentially larger)
- Capital constraints ($18.7M vs competitors raising $30-50M+)
- Brand awareness (not as well-known as TrueProfit in Shopify community)
- Attribution limitations (UTM-only tracking, per competitive analysis in File 132)

**Why BeProfit Got Acquired (vs Continuing Independently):**
- **Capital efficiency ceiling:** $18.7M funding insufficient to dominate category; next raise would dilute founders significantly
- **Competitive pressure:** TrueProfit, Lifetimely, emerging competitors required escalating marketing spend
- **Strategic premium:** Viably offered synergies (funding + analytics integration) that made acquisition attractive vs grinding out 5-10 more years
- **Founder liquidity:** After 8 years (2016-2024), founders may have sought exit opportunity

**Implications for Our Product:**
- BeProfit's exit validates profit analytics market (acquirer willing to pay for user base + product)
- Small team can win (don't need 100+ employees to be acquisition target)
- Integration breadth matters (Viably likely valued BeProfit's API connections to ad platforms, Shopify, etc.)
- Attribution weakness exploitable (we can differentiate with superior attribution if we solve multi-touch problem)

### Founder Background Lessons

**Eden Amirav (CEO) Profile:**
- Serial entrepreneur (first company at 16) = comfort with risk, resilience
- Forbes 30 Under 30 = external validation, PR/networking asset
- Marketing background (affiliate, media buying) = strong growth marketing instincts
- **Implication:** Founder-market fit matters - e-commerce analytics founder should understand both finance AND marketing

**Uri Sittan (CTO) Profile:**
- Enterprise experience (SAP) = quality, testing rigor
- Logistics background (UPS) = understanding complex data integrations
- Previous startup CTO (XBRAIN) = knows how to build from scratch
- **Implication:** CTO with enterprise + startup experience valuable (quality + speed balance)

**Co-Founder Team:**
- 4 co-founders = collaborative leadership, distributed expertise
- CEO/CTO/COO split = clear functional separation
- **Implication:** Strong founding team with complementary skills (not solo founder) increases execution capability

### Acquisition Strategy Insights

**Viably's Acquisition Thesis:**
1. **Vertical Integration:** Funding (Viably) + Analytics (BeProfit) = complete platform
2. **Customer Expansion:** Access to BeProfit's Shopify/WooCommerce merchant base
3. **Product Differentiation:** Competitors (Shopify Capital, Clearco) lack analytics
4. **Data Advantage:** Profit data improves underwriting accuracy

**Potential Acquirers for Our Product:**
Using Viably's thesis as template, logical acquirers:

1. **Payment Processors:** Stripe, Square, PayPal (add analytics to payment data)
2. **E-commerce Platforms:** Shopify (acquire to enhance native analytics), BigCommerce
3. **Accounting Software:** Intuit (QuickBooks), Xero (integrate e-commerce profit tracking)
4. **Fintech Lenders:** Shopify Capital, Clearco, Wayflyer (same thesis as Viably)
5. **Marketing Platforms:** HubSpot, Klaviyo (add profit attribution to marketing analytics)
6. **Private Equity Roll-Ups:** E-commerce SaaS aggregators consolidating tools

**Build-for-Acquisition Tactics:**
- Prioritize integrations that potential acquirers value (Stripe API, Shopify deep integration)
- Build clean data architecture (easy to integrate into acquirer's systems)
- Document IP clearly (patents on attribution algorithms if applicable)
- Maintain clean financials (SaaS metrics, cohort retention data ready for due diligence)
- Cultivate relationships with corporate development teams at potential acquirers

### Risk Mitigation from BeProfit's Story

**Risk: Pivot Fatigue**
- BeProfit pivoted once successfully (lending → analytics), but pivots are risky
- **Mitigation:** Launch with clear product focus, avoid "pivot as strategy" mentality

**Risk: Services Distraction**
- Wise Advice partnership added complexity (software + services harder to scale)
- **Mitigation:** Stay software-focused; partnerships ok but don't dilute core product development

**Risk: Acquisition Dependency**
- If BeProfit's only exit was acquisition (vs sustainable independence), that's fragile
- **Mitigation:** Build to profitability, not exit - acquisition should be option, not necessity

**Risk: Brand Confusion**
- Multiple names (Become, Lending Express, BeProfit) creates confusion
- **Mitigation:** Consistent branding from day one
