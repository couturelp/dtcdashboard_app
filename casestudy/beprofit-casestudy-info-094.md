## Relevance to Our Build

### Demo Strategy

**Should we offer a freely accessible demo or gate it behind email?**
- **Free demo (no gate):**
  - Pros: Wider reach, lower friction, better SEO, builds trust
  - Cons: No lead capture, can't personalize follow-up, lower perceived value
  - Best for: PLG model, high traffic, long sales cycle, complex product needing education

- **Email-gated demo:**
  - Pros: Lead capture, personalized follow-up, qualify interest, retargeting opportunity
  - Cons: Friction reduces views, fewer shares, lower SEO value
  - Best for: SLG model, lower traffic, short sales cycle, need to qualify leads

- **Hybrid approach (recommended):**
  - Free: Short video demo (1-2 min overview)
  - Email-gated: Full interactive demo or extended walkthrough (10-15 min)
  - Sales-gated: Personalized live demo with Q&A
  - **Why**: Serves all funnel stages, maximizes reach + lead capture

**Interactive demo vs video walkthrough vs sales-led demo (or all three?)**
- **Interactive demo:**
  - Best for: Product understanding, feature discovery, self-serve evaluation
  - Investment: Medium (third-party platform $100-500/mo or custom build $10K-50K)
  - Conversion impact: High (users who interact with demo convert 2-3x better)

- **Video walkthrough:**
  - Best for: Quick overview, social sharing, SEO, low-effort consumption
  - Investment: Low (DIY $0 or professional $2K-10K one-time)
  - Conversion impact: Medium (passive consumption, lower engagement)

- **Sales-led demo:**
  - Best for: Enterprise deals, complex setups, high-touch qualification
  - Investment: High (sales team time, demo prep, follow-up)
  - Conversion impact: Highest for qualified leads (personalized, addresses objections)

- **Recommended approach: All three**
  - Phase 1 (Launch): Video walkthrough (easy to create, wide reach)
  - Phase 2 (Month 3): Interactive demo (once product stable, high-value addition)
  - Phase 3 (Month 6): Sales-led demos (once pipeline justifies sales resources)

**Third-party demo platform vs custom-built tour:**
- **Third-party (e.g., Navattic, Arcade):**
  - Pros: Fast setup, no engineering, analytics included, regular updates
  - Cons: Monthly cost ($200-500), customization limits, dependency
  - Best for: MVP, testing demand, limited eng resources

- **Custom-built:**
  - Pros: Full control, no ongoing cost, perfect product match, brand consistency
  - Cons: Engineering time (2-4 weeks), maintenance burden, no analytics out-of-box
  - Best for: Mature product, engineering capacity, long-term investment

- **Recommendation**: Start with third-party (validate demand), build custom later if ROI justifies

### Lead Generation Balance

**Low-friction demos for broad top-of-funnel awareness:**
- Free video demos on YouTube (SEO, viral potential, low commitment)
- Embedded product screenshots/GIFs (no click required, visual engagement)
- Public product tour (no signup, anyone can explore)
- **Goal**: Brand awareness, education, content marketing

**Gated demos for mid-funnel lead capture:**
- Email-gated interactive demo (qualify interest, enable retargeting)
- Downloadable demo video + guide (higher value = acceptable friction)
- Demo + free trial combo (capture email, grant trial access)
- **Goal**: Lead generation, nurture pipeline, personalized follow-up

**Sales-led demos for high-value enterprise leads:**
- Qualification form + scheduled demo (ensure fit, allocate sales time wisely)
- Custom demo environment (personalized with their data/branding)
- Technical demo with Q&A (address specific enterprise concerns)
- **Goal**: Close high-value deals, build relationships, custom solutions

### Product Tour Design

**First-time user onboarding tour (critical for retention):**
- Trigger: Immediately after signup (first login)
- Length: 5-7 steps (don't overwhelm)
- Focus: Quick wins (show value fast - "see your first profit metric in 60 seconds")
- Skippable: Yes (power users hate tours)
- Replayable: Yes (help menu > "Restart tour")
- **Critical success factor**: Get user to "aha moment" in <5 minutes

**Feature discovery tours (help users find advanced features):**
- Trigger: Contextual (when user encounters feature area) or manual (help menu)
- Length: 3-5 steps per feature
- Focus: Specific feature value ("Track ad ROI with this feature")
- Multiple tours: Yes (one per feature cluster - reporting, integrations, settings)
- **Goal**: Increase feature adoption, reduce support tickets

**Tour length and skippability (balance education with friction):**
- Ideal length: 5-7 steps (research shows 7±2 is optimal for retention)
- Max length: 10 steps (longer = higher drop-off)
- Skip option: Always visible (respect user agency)
- Progress indicator: Yes ("Step 3 of 7" reduces anxiety)
- **Testing**: A/B test tour length, measure completion rate + activation rate

### Video Content

**Professional product walkthrough video for YouTube and embedding:**
- Length: 2-3 minutes (attention span sweet spot)
- Format: Screen recording + professional voiceover + music
- Structure: Problem (15s) → Solution overview (30s) → Feature walkthrough (90s) → CTA (15s)
- Production: Professional ($2K-5K) or high-quality DIY ($0 + time)
- SEO: Optimize title/description for "[Product category] walkthrough" keywords
- Distribution: YouTube, homepage, pricing page, email campaigns
- **Goal**: Evergreen top-of-funnel content, shareable, ranks for branded searches

**Feature-specific tutorial videos:**
- Length: 1-2 minutes per video
- Topics: One per major feature (profit tracking, ad ROAS, multi-store, reports)
- Format: Screen recording + clear narration, no face needed
- Production: In-house (lightweight, can iterate quickly)
- SEO: Optimize for "how to [use feature]" queries
- Distribution: YouTube playlist, help center, in-app contextual help
- **Goal**: Feature adoption, reduce support burden, SEO long-tail

**Customer testimonial videos:**
- Length: 30-90 seconds (short attention span)
- Format: Customer talking head + B-roll of them using product
- Content: Problem → Solution → Results (with metrics)
- Production: Professional (credibility) or high-quality user-generated (authenticity)
- Quantity: 3-5 to start, add 1-2/quarter
- Distribution: Homepage, pricing page, case study pages, sales demos
- **Goal**: Social proof, trust building, objection handling

**YouTube channel for content marketing and SEO:**
- Purpose: Content hub, SEO, thought leadership
- Content mix: 50% product demos/tutorials, 30% educational (industry tips), 20% customer stories
- Upload frequency: Weekly (consistency matters more than volume)
- Optimization: Keywords in titles, timestamps in descriptions, playlists
- **Goal**: Organic discovery, brand authority, long-term SEO asset

### CTA Strategy

**Primary CTA consistency across site:**
- Pick ONE primary CTA for entire site: "Start Free Trial" (or "Request Demo" if sales-led)
- Use identical copy everywhere (builds familiarity, reduces decision fatigue)
- Consistent button style (color, size, placement)
- **Why consistency**: Users shouldn't wonder what to click - make default action obvious

**Intent-based CTAs (different CTAs for different user needs):**
- Early-stage visitors (awareness): "See How It Works" (low commitment, educational)
- Mid-stage visitors (consideration): "Try Free Trial" (hands-on evaluation)
- Late-stage visitors (decision): "Talk to Sales" or "View Pricing" (ready to buy)
- **Implementation**: Match CTA to page intent (blog = "See How It Works", pricing = "Start Trial")

**CTA placement optimization (hero, after social proof, exit-intent):**
- Hero (above fold): Primary CTA (highest visibility)
- After value props: Primary CTA (reinforcement after education)
- After social proof: Primary CTA (credibility boost before ask)
- After pricing: Primary CTA (decision point)
- Footer: Primary CTA (last chance before leaving)
- Exit-intent: Alternative CTA (e.g., "Download Guide" if not ready to trial)
- **Rule of thumb**: Primary CTA every 1-2 scrolls (always within reach, not intrusive)
