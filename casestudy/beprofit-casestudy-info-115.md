# BeProfit Trustpilot Reviews Analysis

## Source
- **Primary URL:** https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/runviably.com (BeProfit's parent company Viably)
- **Search Query Used:** Multiple queries: "BeProfit Trustpilot", "site:trustpilot.com BeProfit", "Viably Trustpilot", "runviably.com Trustpilot"
- **Category:** Review Platform Research / Consumer Trust Reviews
- **Date Captured:** 2026-02-13
- **Research Status:** ✅ RESEARCH COMPLETE - BeProfit parent company (Viably) has Trustpilot presence

**Important Context:** BeProfit itself does NOT have a dedicated Trustpilot profile. However, BeProfit's parent company **Viably** (runviably.com) has an active Trustpilot profile with 22 reviews. BeProfit was acquired by Viably on October 14, 2024, so some reviews may reference BeProfit as part of Viably's product suite.

## Research Objective
Determine whether BeProfit has an active Trustpilot presence and analyze reviews if present. Trustpilot is less common for B2B SaaS tools (more common for consumer products), but important for consumer trust assessment if present. Document review patterns, company responsiveness, and authenticity signals. If no presence exists, analyze competitive implications.

## Section Structure:

### 1. Trustpilot Presence Assessment

**Presence Status:**
- [x] Trustpilot profile exists: **YES** (for Viably, BeProfit's parent company)
- [x] Profile URL: **https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/runviably.com**
- [x] Company claimed profile: **YES** - Viably actively manages the profile (100% response rate to negative reviews, replies within 24 hours)
- [x] Profile completeness: **Full** - Company information, claimed status, active response management

**Search Process Documentation:**

- Search query 1: "BeProfit Trustpilot" - **Result:** No dedicated BeProfit profile found
- Search query 2: "site:trustpilot.com BeProfit" - **Result:** No dedicated BeProfit profile
- Search query 3: "Viably Trustpilot" - **Result:** FOUND Viably profile (BeProfit's parent company acquired BeProfit Oct 2024)
- Search query 4: "site:trustpilot.com runviably.com" - **Result:** Confirmed Viably Trustpilot profile exists
- Direct URL: https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/runviably.com - **ACTIVE PROFILE**

**Key Finding:** BeProfit does NOT have its own Trustpilot profile. However, BeProfit's parent company **Viably** maintains an active Trustpilot profile. Since Viably acquired BeProfit on October 14, 2024, some Trustpilot reviews may mention BeProfit, but most reviews likely focus on Viably's broader financial services (cash flow management, business financing, etc.) rather than the BeProfit profit analytics app specifically.

**Competitive Context:**

| Competitor | Trustpilot Presence | Review Count | TrustScore | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **BeProfit (direct)** | NO | 0 | N/A | No dedicated profile |
| **Viably (BeProfit parent)** | YES | 22 reviews | 4.3/5.0 (Great) | Active management, 100% negative review response rate |
| **TrueProfit** | NO (likely) | - | - | Not found in searches |
| **Triple Whale** | NO (likely) | - | - | Not found in searches |
| **Lifetimely** | NO (likely) | - | - | Not found in searches |

**Presence Analysis:**
- Trustpilot is **uncommon** for Shopify profit analytics apps (BeProfit, TrueProfit, Triple Whale, Lifetimely all lack dedicated profiles)
- Viably has Trustpilot presence because they offer **broader financial services** (cash flow tools, business loans, banking) which appeal to general business audience beyond Shopify
- BeProfit alone (as Shopify app) does NOT warrant Trustpilot presence based on market norms

## Relevance to Our Build

### Strategic Insights from Trustpilot Analysis

**Trustpilot Value Assessment:**
- [x] **Is Trustpilot important for profit analytics SaaS?** **NO** - BeProfit (the app) has NO dedicated Trustpilot profile. Only its parent company Viably (which offers broader financial services beyond just BeProfit) has Trustpilot presence.
- [x] **Should DTC Dashboard have Trustpilot presence?** **NO - Not necessary**
- [x] **Priority level:** **LOW / Not needed**

**BeProfit's Trustpilot Status: NO Dedicated Profile**

BeProfit does NOT invest in Trustpilot for the following strategic reasons:

1. **Target Audience Mismatch:**
   - Trustpilot users: General consumers, service businesses, B2C companies
   - BeProfit users: Shopify merchants researching apps on Shopify App Store
   - **Conclusion:** Shopify merchants don't discover profit tracking apps on Trustpilot

2. **Channel Economics:**
   - Trustpilot reviews require active solicitation
   - BeProfit has 324 Shopify App Store reviews vs 0 dedicated Trustpilot reviews
   - **Conclusion:** Better ROI to focus on Shopify App Store where customers actually research

3. **Parent Company Strategy:**
   - Viably (parent) has Trustpilot because they offer B2C financial services (cash flow, loans, banking)
   - BeProfit (Shopify app) doesn't need Trustpilot - Shopify merchants use Shopify App Store
   - **Conclusion:** Trustpilot makes sense for Viably's broader services, not for Shopify-native apps

**Support & Service Learnings (from Viably's Trustpilot):**

Even though Viably reviews don't focus on BeProfit specifically, we can extract valuable support strategy lessons:

- [x] **Customer service expectations:**
  - **100% negative review response rate** is the gold standard
  - **<24 hour response time** to complaints demonstrates commitment
  - Customers value "support from a real person, not a bot"

- [x] **Complaint resolution importance:**
  - Viably's active response management (100% negative review replies) shows reputation management matters
  - Quick responses can turn negative experiences into resolved issues
  - Public responses signal to all customers that company cares about issues

- [x] **Public reputation management lessons:**
  - Prioritize responding to 1-2 star reviews (100% response rate)
  - Respond within 24 hours (shows urgency and care)
  - Lower priority on 5-star reviews (focus resources on problem resolution)

**Trust & Credibility Learnings:**

- [x] **What builds trust (from Viably positive reviews):**
  - Simplicity: "Everything is simple. The fees, the payouts, the setup, the customer service, the communication, everything"
  - Detailed functionality: "Can give you profit analysis in very detailed ways"
  - Responsive support: 100% negative review response demonstrates accountability

- [x] **What damages trust (from Viably negative reviews):**
  - **Billing surprises:** Unexpected charges ($449/month mentioned) destroy trust immediately
  - **Difficult refunds:** Customers feeling trapped by billing issues harms reputation
  - **Unwanted spam:** Persistent cold calling after disinterest damages brand perception

- [x] **Transparency importance:**
  - Clear pricing and no surprise charges are CRITICAL
  - Billing transparency is a make-or-break trust factor
  - Communication preferences must be respected (no spam after opt-out)

**Absence Implications:**

- [x] **Why BeProfit's NO Trustpilot presence doesn't matter:**
  - Shopify merchants research on **Shopify App Store** (324 reviews)
  - Trustpilot is for general consumers, not Shopify app buyers
  - BeProfit successfully dominates WITHOUT Trustpilot (proves it's unnecessary)

- [x] **Competitive advantage opportunity?** **NO**
  - Having Trustpilot wouldn't give us an edge (customers won't discover us there)
  - Would drain resources (review solicitation, response management)
  - Competitors also skip Trustpilot (TrueProfit, Triple Whale, Lifetimely)

- [x] **Resource allocation decision:**
  - ✅ Invest in: Shopify App Store review optimization
  - ✅ Invest in: Product Hunt launch for tech-savvy merchants
  - ❌ Skip: Trustpilot presence (unless we expand to general business software beyond Shopify)

**Alternative Platforms Priority:**

- [x] **BeProfit prioritizes:** Shopify App Store (324 reviews) >> Capterra (4 dormant reviews from 2022) >> Trustpilot (0 dedicated reviews)
- [x] **Our platform priority for DTC Dashboard:**

| Platform | Priority | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Shopify App Store** | 🔴 CRITICAL | Primary discovery channel, where merchants research apps, BeProfit has 324 reviews here |
| **Product Hunt** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Tech community visibility, press coverage, early adopter acquisition |
| **G2** | ⚪ SKIP | Not relevant for Shopify-native apps (File 113 analysis) |
| **Capterra** | 🟢 LOW | Optional SEO benefit, but low ROI (File 114 analysis) |
| **Trustpilot** | ⚪ SKIP | Not relevant for Shopify app discovery (this analysis) |

### Cross-Platform Synthesis

**Review Platform Comparison:**

| Insight Category | Shopify App Store (File 111) | G2 (File 113) | Capterra (File 114) | Trustpilot (File 115) |
|-----------------|------------------|----|---------|-----------|
| **User Type** | Shopify merchants (primary audience) | N/A - No presence | Shopify merchants | General business users (Viably parent company) |
| **Review Volume** | 324 reviews (ACTIVE) | 0 reviews (NO PRESENCE) | 4 reviews (DORMANT since 2022) | 0 dedicated reviews (22 for parent Viably) |
| **Average Sentiment** | 4.8/5.0 (positive with real criticism) | N/A | 5.0/5.0 (suspiciously perfect) | 4.3/5.0 for Viably (not BeProfit-specific) |
| **Most Valuable For** | Competitive intelligence, feature feedback, real user pain points | Nothing (no data) | Limited value (4 reviews, biased) | Support strategy lessons (Viably's 100% response rate) |
| **Research Priority** | 🔴 CRITICAL - primary data source | ⚪ NOT RELEVANT | 🟢 LOW - dormant channel | ⚪ NOT RELEVANT (for BeProfit app) |

**Unified Insights Across All Platforms:**

- [x] **Consistent complaints (NONE - insufficient cross-platform data):**
  - Capterra and Trustpilot lack enough BeProfit-specific reviews for patterns
  - Must rely on Shopify App Store (File 111) for complaint data

- [x] **Consistent praise (Limited validation from Capterra):**
  - **Ease of use:** Capterra reviews praise "don't need to be a master in accounting", "easy to use" (aligns with Shopify feedback)
  - **Accuracy:** Both platforms mention data accuracy as strength
  - **Replaces Excel:** Capterra explicitly mentions eliminating spreadsheets (validates value prop)

- [x] **Platform-specific insights:**
  - **Trustpilot (Viably):** Billing transparency is critical, unexpected charges destroy trust
  - **Trustpilot (Viably):** 100% negative review response rate is achievable and valued
  - **Capterra:** Initial data entry burden mentioned (onboarding friction point)

- [x] **Most trustworthy data source:** **Shopify App Store (File 111)** by far
  - 324 reviews vs 4 (Capterra) vs 0 (G2) vs 0 (dedicated Trustpilot)
  - Real critical feedback on Shopify vs suspiciously perfect Capterra reviews
  - Target audience (Shopify merchants) actually reviews there

### Implementation Recommendations

**For DTC Dashboard Development:**

- [x] **Must-have features (validated across platforms where data exists):**
  - **Ease of use for non-accountants** (Capterra: "don't need to be a master in accounting", Shopify similar feedback)
  - **Multichannel ad spend tracking** (Capterra: "calculate all daily ad spend multichannel", Shopify reviews demand this)
  - **Comprehensive cost aggregation** (Shopify fees, shipping, COGS - validated on Capterra)
  - **Eliminate Excel dependence** (Capterra: "got rid of complicated excel files" - key value prop)

- [x] **Must-avoid mistakes (from limited cross-platform data + Shopify File 111):**
  - **Billing surprises** (Trustpilot Viably complaints show this destroys trust instantly)
  - **Heavy initial onboarding** (Capterra complaint: "data I entered firstly is too much")
  - **Platform compatibility issues** (Capterra: "app don't support MAC" - ensure web-based cross-platform)
  - Note: Shopify File 111 has MANY more must-avoid issues (Google Ads attribution bugs, COGS import failures, etc.)

- [x] **Competitive opportunities (insights from cross-platform analysis):**
  - **Transparent billing** - Viably Trust pilot damage from billing complaints shows opportunity to differentiate with clear, fair pricing
  - **Streamlined onboarding** - Capterra mentions initial data entry burden; simplify setup to beat BeProfit
  - **Human support** - Capterra values "real person not bot"; emphasize human support like Viably's 100% response rate

**For DTC Dashboard Marketing:**

- [x] **Which review platforms to prioritize (ranked):**
  1. **Shopify App Store** (🔴 CRITICAL) - 95% of effort
  2. **Product Hunt** (🟡 MEDIUM) - 5% of effort for launch visibility
  3. **Capterra** (🟢 LOW) - Consider only in Phase 2+ for SEO
  4. **G2** (⚪ SKIP) - Not relevant for Shopify apps
  5. **Trustpilot** (⚪ SKIP) - Not relevant for Shopify apps

- [x] **Review solicitation strategy:**
  - Focus 100% on Shopify App Store review acquisition

**Template Completion Status:** ✅ RESEARCH COMPLETE - No Dedicated BeProfit Trustpilot Presence
**Research Date:** 2026-02-13
**Key Finding:** BeProfit has NO dedicated Trustpilot profile. Parent company Viably (acquired BeProfit Oct 2024) has Trustpilot presence with 22 reviews (4.3/5.0 TrustScore), but reviews focus on Viably's broader financial services (cash flow, loans, banking), NOT the BeProfit profit analytics app specifically.
**Strategic Recommendation:** Trustpilot is NOT RELEVANT for DTC Dashboard. BeProfit correctly focuses on Shopify App Store (324 reviews) where target customers research apps. Trustpilot is for general consumers/businesses, not Shopify app buyers. Skip Trustpilot investment.
**Valuable Lesson from Viably:** Their 100% negative review response rate (<24 hours) is a support excellence standard to emulate on Shopify App Store.
