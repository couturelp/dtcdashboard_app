# BeProfit User Sentiment Synthesis — Most Criticized Features & Pain Points

## Source
- **Synthesis From:** Files 111-116 (all review sources, focusing on negative reviews)
- **Category:** User Sentiment Synthesis / Pain Points Analysis
- **Date Captured:** [to be filled during synthesis work]
- **Research Status:** ⚠️ TEMPLATE - Requires synthesis of all negative review data

## Research Objective
Aggregate and rank the most commonly criticized features, bugs, missing capabilities, and pain points from BeProfit across ALL review sources. Identify what users genuinely dislike, which issues cause frustration or churn, and what competitive vulnerabilities exist. This synthesis provides strategic insight into mistakes to avoid and gaps to fill in our competing product.

## Methodology

### Data Sources for This Synthesis
- [x] Shopify App Store negative reviews (files 111-112) - 1-3 star reviews
- [x] G2 reviews (file 113) - cons sections and mixed reviews
- [x] Capterra reviews (file 114) - cons sections
- [x] Trustpilot reviews (file 115) - 1-3 star reviews
- [x] Other sources (file 116) - Reddit complaints, YouTube criticism, negative social media

### Synthesis Approach
1. Extract all complaints, criticisms, pain points from each source
2. Normalize similar complaints into common issue categories
3. Count frequency of each criticized aspect across all sources
4. Assess severity (Critical / Major / Minor)
5. Rank issues by combination of frequency + severity
6. Collect quote evidence for top issues
7. Track resolution status (acknowledged, fixed, ongoing, ignored)
8. Identify patterns and recurring themes
