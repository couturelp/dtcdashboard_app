## Key Observations

### Content Organization Patterns
1. **Two-tier navigation:** The landing page shows only 6 "tile" categories, but the sidebar reveals 21 total categories/subcategories. This means the landing page dramatically understates the depth of the knowledge base.
2. **Uneven content distribution:** "Costs & Expenses" is by far the largest category (18 articles), suggesting this is where users have the most questions. Products (12) and Marketing Analytics (~19) are the next largest.
3. **Sparse categories:** Several categories have only 1 article (Account, Taxes, Working Capital, Plus Plan, Amazon, TikTok), suggesting either new/developing documentation or features that are simple enough to not need extensive docs.
4. **Cross-referencing in Getting Started:** The Getting Started page acts as a hub that references other categories rather than having its own deep content. This is an unusual pattern — it implies the onboarding documentation is spread across feature-specific categories rather than consolidated.
5. **No dedicated "Integrations" or "Store Connection" category:** Store connection documentation appears scattered across multiple categories (General, Products, Fulfillment, Marketing Analytics), rather than having a centralized integrations section.
6. **Platform-specific categories:** Amazon and TikTok have their own categories with only 1 article each, suggesting these are newer integrations or platform-specific features that don't yet have deep documentation.

### Search & Discovery
- Auto-suggest search is available on all pages
- No visible "popular articles" or "trending" sections on the landing page
- No visible "recently updated" or "new articles" indicators
- The sidebar serves as the primary discovery mechanism beyond search

### URL Patterns
- Most article URLs follow the pattern: `help.runviably.com/beprofit/[slug]`
- Many articles append `-beprofit-help-center` to the slug
- Category pages use the same base pattern: `help.runviably.com/beprofit/[category-slug]`
- Subcategory pages do not appear to have their own direct URLs — they are rendered within parent category pages

### Missing Documentation Gaps
- No visible "API documentation" or "developer docs" section
- No "changelog" or "what's new" section
- No "video tutorials" or "webinar" section
- No "community" or "forum" section
- No "system status" or "uptime" page linked from help center

## Relevance to Our Build

### Information Architecture Takeaways
1. **Category structure reflects the product's core domains:** Dashboard, Products, Marketing, Fulfillment, Costs, Reports — this mirrors the product's main navigation and should inform our own help center organization.
2. **Costs & Expenses dominance suggests complexity:** The high article count in this category reveals that cost management is the product's most complex area. Our own COGS and expense tracking UI should prioritize clarity and in-app guidance to reduce support burden.
3. **Cross-referencing pattern in Getting Started:** Rather than duplicating content, BeProfit links users from Getting Started to feature-specific docs. This is efficient but may frustrate new users who want a linear onboarding guide. We should consider whether to consolidate our onboarding docs.
4. **Sparse platform-specific sections:** Amazon and TikTok having their own categories with minimal content suggests these are differentiating features worth highlighting even when documentation is thin. We should consider how to structure platform-specific content.
5. **No API docs visible:** This may mean BeProfit doesn't offer a public API, or docs are hosted elsewhere. Worth investigating for our competitive positioning.
6. **Help center is Viably-branded:** The transition from BeProfit to Viably branding in the help center suggests a parent company / rebrand. Our product should be aware of this branding transition in the market.
