## Executive Summary

BeProfit targets a focused keyword strategy centered on "profit analytics" and related ecommerce profitability terms, with strong emphasis on multi-store capabilities and platform-specific integrations. The core keyword theme revolves around profit tracking, COGS management, and ad spend attribution — positioning BeProfit as a comprehensive profit analytics solution for ecommerce sellers. Primary keywords include "profit analytics", "profit analysis", "ecommerce profit tracking", and "COGS calculator", with secondary keywords targeting specific platforms ("shopify profit app", "woocommerce analytics") and features ("product profit analysis", "ad spend tracking"). BeProfit demonstrates strong keyword-to-page mapping with dedicated landing pages for major features, though keyword opportunities exist in comparison content ("beprofit vs competitor"), calculator tools (interactive SEO magnets), and educational long-tail keywords ("how to calculate profit margins for shopify"). The keyword strategy balances commercial intent (feature pages, pricing) with informational intent (blog content), creating a content-to-conversion funnel that captures users at various stages of awareness.

## Keyword Gaps & Opportunities

### High-Value Keywords BeProfit Doesn't Target Well

**1. "free profit calculator shopify"**
- **Search volume:** Medium-High
- **Difficulty:** Low (niche, transactional)
- **Why it's an opportunity:** Users want free calculators; "free" is powerful keyword. BeProfit has calculators but doesn't optimize for "free" keyword.
- **How we can capture it:**
  - Create landing page: "Free Shopify Profit Calculator — No Signup Required"
  - Make calculator truly free (no email gate initially)
  - After calculation, offer "Automate this with [OurProduct] — Free Trial"

**2. "[Brand] vs [Competitor]" comparison keywords**

- **Search volume:** Low-Medium per keyword, but high aggregate volume
- **Difficulty:** Low (specific, long-tail)
- **Why it's an opportunity:** Users in decision stage, high commercial intent. BeProfit doesn't create comparison content.
- **How we can capture it:**
  - Create "OurProduct vs BeProfit vs TrueProfit" comparison page

  - Highlight our differentiators
  - CTA to our trial

**3. "how to calculate true profit ecommerce"**
- **Search volume:** Low-Medium

  - Create comprehensive guide: "How to Calculate True Profit for Your Ecommerce Business"
  - Explain all expense categories (COGS, shipping, ads, fees, returns)
  - Provide calculation template

  - Create landing page: "Multi-Channel Profit Tracking — Shopify, Amazon, Etsy, WooCommerce"
  - Explain challenges of multi-channel profit tracking
  - Showcase unified dashboard
  - CTA to trial

**6-10. Additional Keyword Gaps:**

- "ecommerce profitability benchmarks" — Create industry benchmark data (original research)

## Summary

BeProfit's keyword strategy is focused and effective, targeting "profit analytics" and related ecommerce profitability terms with strong emphasis on multi-store capabilities and platform integrations. The keyword approach balances commercial intent (feature pages, pricing) with informational intent (blog content), creating a content-to-conversion funnel. However, significant keyword opportunities remain unexploited: comparison content (BeProfit vs competitors), interactive calculator tools (COGS calculator, profit margin calculator), and educational long-tail keywords (how to calculate shopify profit margins).

**Key Keyword Themes:**
1. Profit tracking & analytics (core)
2. COGS & cost management
3. Ad spend attribution & marketing ROI
4. Platform integrations (Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon)
5. Feature-specific analysis (product, order, shipping, returns)
6. Calculators & tools (SEO magnets)

**Our Keyword Strategy:**
- **Primary Keywords (10):** Target high-volume, high-intent keywords (profit analytics, shopify profit calculator, COGS calculator)
- **Secondary Keywords (20):** Target medium-volume, feature-specific keywords (product profit analysis, ad spend tracking)
- **Long-Tail Keywords (50+):** Target low-volume, high-intent keywords for quick wins (how to calculate shopify profit margins, beprofit vs trueprofit)

**Content Roadmap:**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-2):** Foundation — 20-25 pages (pillar pages, feature pages, calculators)
- **Phase 2 (Months 3-6):** Expansion — 50-60 pages (blog content, comparison pages, integration pages)
- **Phase 3 (Months 7-12):** Domination — 100+ pages (comprehensive guides, video content, original research)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Month 12: 2,000-5,000 organic visitors/month
- 30+ keywords in top 50 positions
- 15+ keywords in top 20 positions
- 5+ keywords in top 10 positions
- 100+ trial signups from organic search

By targeting BeProfit's keyword gaps (calculators, comparison content, long-tail educational keywords) and executing a comprehensive content strategy, we can capture significant organic traffic and convert search visitors into trial users and customers.
