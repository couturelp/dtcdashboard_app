# BeProfit User Sentiment Synthesis — Common Feature Requests

## Source
- **Synthesis From:** Files 111-116 (all review sources, extracting feature requests)
- **Category:** User Sentiment Synthesis / Feature Requests Analysis
- **Date Captured:** [to be filled during synthesis work]
- **Research Status:** ⚠️ TEMPLATE - Requires synthesis of all feature request data

## Research Objective
Aggregate and prioritize feature requests from users across ALL review sources. Identify what capabilities users wish BeProfit had, assess urgency and user impact, determine if requested features truly don't exist or are just hidden/undiscovered, and cross-reference with competitor capabilities. This synthesis informs our competing product's feature roadmap.

## Methodology

### Data Sources for This Synthesis
- [x] Shopify App Store reviews (files 111-112) - feature request sections
- [x] G2 reviews (file 113) - "What could be improved" sections
- [x] Capterra reviews (file 114) - suggestions and missing features
- [x] Trustpilot reviews (file 115) - improvement suggestions
- [x] Other sources (file 116) - Reddit wish lists, YouTube suggestions, Product Hunt comments

### Synthesis Approach
1. Extract all feature requests from each review source
2. Normalize similar requests into common feature descriptions
3. Count frequency of each request across all sources
4. Assess urgency (how badly users want this)
5. Assess user impact (how many users would benefit)
6. Cross-reference with BeProfit's known capabilities (from PRD Parts 01-05 help center research)
   - Is feature truly missing OR just hidden/hard to find?
7. Check if competitors offer requested features
8. Rank requests by strategic value (frequency + impact + competitive differentiation)
9. Categorize requests by feature type

## Section Structure:

### 1. Ranked List of Most Requested Features

**Ranking Methodology:**
- Request frequency: How often mentioned across all sources
- Urgency signals: Language like "desperately need", "must have", "deal-breaker"
- User impact: % of user base that would benefit
- Competitive presence: Do competitors offer this?
- Strategic value: Differentiation potential for our product

**Top 30 Most Requested Features:**

#### Rank #1: [Feature Name - e.g., "Multi-Currency Support"]

- [ ] Feature exists but with limitations (e.g., only 1 currency, users want multiple)
- [ ] Users don't know it exists (discovery/onboarding problem)

**Competitive Analysis:**
**Do competitors offer this feature?**
| Competitor | Has Feature? | Implementation Quality | Evidence |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|----------|
| TrueProfit | [Yes/No/Partial] | [Better/Similar/Worse than requested] | "[Source]" |
| Lifetimely | [Yes/No/Partial] | | |
