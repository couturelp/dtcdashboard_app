## Relevance to Our Build

### Partner Program Decision

**Should we launch with a partner program or build it post-launch?**
- **Pre-launch:** Simple affiliate program (low effort, extends reach)
- **Post-launch (Month 3-6):** Formal agency program once we have case studies and proven product-market fit
- **Long-term (Year 2):** White-label or reseller program for strategic partnerships
- **Rationale:** Focus on direct customers first, add partners once we understand customer needs and have social proof

**Which partner types should we prioritize first?**
- **Priority 1:** Affiliate program (low effort, broad reach, performance-based)
- **Priority 2:** Agency program (high-value, recurring, aligned incentives)
- **Priority 3:** Technology partners (integration ecosystem, product enhancement)
- **Not initially:** White-label/reseller (complex, requires mature product and support)

**What resources are needed to run a partner program?**
- **Minimum viable program:**
  - Affiliate platform subscription ($100-500/month)
  - Marketing materials (one-pagers, decks)
  - Commission structure definition
  - Partner onboarding email sequence
  - Basic partner documentation

- **Full agency program:**
  - Partner portal (build or buy - $10K-50K)
  - Multi-client dashboard feature development
  - Dedicated partner manager (hire or part-time role)
  - Training content creation (videos, docs, certification)
  - Co-marketing campaign budget
  - Legal contracts and commission tracking

### Agency Features Planning

**Multi-client dashboard requirements:**
- View all clients in one dashboard (list view, metrics summary)
- Switch between client accounts (single click, no re-login)
- Aggregate reporting (total clients, total revenue, total usage)
- Bulk actions (send announcements, update settings)
- Client provisioning (create new client account from agency dashboard)

**White-label or co-branding capabilities:**
- Phase 1 (Basic): Partner logo in client dashboards, co-branded emails
- Phase 2 (Advanced): Custom domain, custom color scheme, custom product name
- Phase 3 (Full white-label): Fully branded experience, partner handles support

**Agency pricing and billing models:**
- Option 1: Agency pays for all clients (bulk discount, agency invoices clients)
- Option 2: Clients pay directly (agency gets commission, BeProfit handles billing)
- Option 3: Hybrid (agency pays wholesale, marks up to clients)
- **Recommended:** Option 2 initially (simpler for us), Option 1 for mature agencies

**Client provisioning and management tools:**
- Self-service client addition (agency creates client accounts via portal)
- Client permissions management (what agencies can see/change in client accounts)
- Client lifecycle management (onboarding, offboarding, status tracking)
- Client usage analytics (help agencies demonstrate value to clients)

### Commission Structure Design

**Competitive commission rates in the industry:**
- Affiliate commissions: 20-30% first payment or 10-15% recurring
- Agency commissions: 15-25% recurring
- Reseller revenue share: 30-50% of customer revenue
- **Research needed:** Check BeProfit and competitor actual rates

**Recurring vs one-time commissions:**
- **Recurring:** Better partner alignment (success = ongoing revenue), higher LTV share
- **One-time:** Simpler tracking, incentivizes volume over quality
- **Recommended:** Recurring for agencies (aligned incentives), one-time + small recurring for affiliates

**Tiered commission models to incentivize growth:**
- Tier 1 (0-10 clients): 15% recurring
- Tier 2 (11-25 clients): 20% recurring
- Tier 3 (26-50 clients): 25% recurring
- Tier 4 (51+ clients): 30% recurring + dedicated manager
- **Locks in top partners, incentivizes scaling**

**Balancing partner profitability with our margins:**
- If product costs 20% (hosting, support, payment processing), and we want 30% margin:
  - Maximum commission: 50% of revenue
  - Recommended commission: 20-25% (leaves room for our growth, partner happy)
- Calculate partner economics: If they manage 20 clients at $100/mo, 20% commission = $400/mo = $4,800/year per agency partner

**Which markets or segments are best served by partners?**
