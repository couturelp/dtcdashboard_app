# BeProfit Case Study — vs OrderMetrics / Other Analytics Tools

**Research Date:** 2026-02-13
**Source Type:** Web Research (Competitor Analysis)
**PRD Reference:** PRD Part 08, Task 3

---

## Executive Summary

This research examines BeProfit's competitive positioning against:
1. **OrderMetrics** — Now defunct (shut down June 30), creating market opportunity BeProfit capitalized on
2. **ProfitWell & Baremetrics** — SaaS-focused analytics tools with limited e-commerce applicability
3. **Peel Insights** — Premium retention analytics platform ($499+/month) competing on deeper customer analytics
4. **Glew Analytics** — Multi-channel e-commerce analytics competing on breadth and BI capabilities

**Key Finding:** BeProfit occupies a mid-market position between budget profit trackers and premium analytics platforms, facing pressure from both directions as market fragments by use case and price point.

---

## Part 1: OrderMetrics — Defunct Competitor Analysis

### OrderMetrics Background

**Status:** **Shut down June 30th** (no year specified in sources, likely 2024 or 2025)

**What OrderMetrics Was:**
- E-commerce profit tracking tool
- Web-based application enabling businesses to manage and analyze order data
- Order information viewed in tables and graphs
- Filters to track orders by country, product, and date

**Market Position:**
Mid-market profit tracking tool competing directly with BeProfit, TrueProfit, and similar apps.

---

### BeProfit's Response to OrderMetrics Shutdown

BeProfit actively marketed itself as the OrderMetrics replacement, creating dedicated content to capture displaced users:

**Marketing Content Created:**
1. "Best OrderMetrics Alternatives for Profit Tracking and Analysis" (blog post)
2. "Why BeProfit Is the Best OrderMetrics Alternative" (blog post)
3. Official comparison pages (BeProfit vs. OrderMetrics)

**Messaging Strategy:**
Position BeProfit as the natural successor with superior features and continued development/support.

---

### What BeProfit Offered to OrderMetrics Users

**Core Value Proposition:**
"#1 profit analysis app for eCommerce sellers" with comprehensive feature set OrderMetrics lacked or had in limited form.

**Key Features Highlighted:**

1. **Unified Dashboard**
   - "Intuitive dashboard to control expenses and profits"
   - Tracking for marketing, orders, products, shipping, and inventory all in one place
   - More comprehensive than OrderMetrics' order-focused approach

2. **Ad Platform Integrations**
   - Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Pinterest Ads, and more
   - Real-time ad spend sync (OrderMetrics had limited ad integration)
   - Ad effectiveness tracking drilling down to campaigns, ad sets, and individual ads

3. **LTV Analysis**
   - Lifetime Value (LTV) analysis by cohorts
   - "Strategize long-term success" (customer retention focus OrderMetrics lacked)

4. **Pricing for OrderMetrics Refugees**
   - Starter plan: $49/month
   - Growth plan: $99/month
   - Ultimate plan: $149/month
   - Plus plan: $249/month (larger operations without order caps)

---

### Competitive Analysis: Why OrderMetrics Failed

While specific failure reasons aren't documented in search results, industry analysis suggests:

**Likely Failure Factors:**

1. **Feature Stagnation** — Competitors (BeProfit, TrueProfit, Lifetimely) added LTV, cohort analysis, predictive analytics; OrderMetrics stayed order-focused

2. **Limited Differentiation** — Basic profit tracking became commoditized; no unique value proposition

3. **Market Fragmentation** — Market split between:
   - Budget tools (Profit Calc, Conversific) for small merchants
   - Premium tools (Peel Insights, Glew) for advanced analytics
   - Mid-market squeezed with high customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value

4. **Technical Debt** — Older "web-based application" architecture vs. modern real-time dashboards

5. **Lack of Mobile** — No indication OrderMetrics had mobile apps in era where mobile became table stakes

**Implication for BeProfit:** Same pressures that killed OrderMetrics (commoditization, fragmentation, feature stagnation) threaten BeProfit unless it differentiates.

---

### Market Opportunity from OrderMetrics Shutdown

**Displaced User Base:**
OrderMetrics had established user base (exact size unknown) suddenly needing replacement tool.

**BeProfit's Advantage:**
- Ready replacement with similar core features + enhancements
- Active marketing campaign targeting OrderMetrics users
- Shopify "staff pick" credibility for trust-building

**Competition for Displaced Users:**
- TrueProfit (lower price, better automation)
- Lifetimely (LTV focus)
- Profit Calc (budget option)
- All competed for same displaced users

**Unknown:** How many OrderMetrics users BeProfit successfully captured vs. competitors.

---

## Part 2: ProfitWell & Baremetrics — SaaS Analytics Tools

### Category Context

**ProfitWell and Baremetrics are SaaS subscription analytics tools, not e-commerce analytics tools.**

**Why They Appear in BeProfit Competitor Research:**
- Both handle payment processor integrations (Stripe, Braintree, Recurly, Chargebee) that some e-commerce businesses use
- Subscription box e-commerce businesses operate on recurring revenue model where these tools are relevant
- Cross-over segment: D2C subscription products (meal kits, beauty boxes, supplement subscriptions)

**Key Limitation:** Optimized for recurring revenue models, not one-time transactional e-commerce that most Shopify merchants operate.

---

### ProfitWell Overview

**Market Position:** Free SaaS subscription analytics with revenue recovery upsell

**Core Products:**
1. **Metrics** — Revenue metrics tracking (MRR, ARR, churn, LTV)
2. **Retain** — Reduces involuntary churn from credit card failures
3. **Recognized** — Revenue recognition for accounting compliance

**Pricing Model:**
- **Metrics:** Free
- **Retain:** Commission-based (percentage of each recovered payment)
- **Recognized:** Paid tier

**Focus:** Revenue automation and recovery more than analytics and reporting

**Integration Support:**
Stripe, Braintree, Recurly, Chargebee, Zuora, Chargify, Recharge (subscription platforms)

---

### Baremetrics Overview

**Market Position:** Premium SaaS analytics with comprehensive feature set

**Core Focus:**
- Real-time subscription metrics
- Cohort analysis
- Customizable dashboards
- Revenue recovery (Baremetrics Recover)

**Pricing Model:**
- Priced based on MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- Baremetrics Recover: Flat monthly rate (not commission-based like ProfitWell)

**Key Differentiation from ProfitWell:**
- More extensive customization options
- Greater focus on analytics and reporting (vs. ProfitWell's automation focus)
- Full control over customer communication (emails, in-app reminders, paywalls)
- "Most comprehensive set of features essential to growing a subscription business, all in one tool"

**Integration Support:**
Stripe, Braintree, Recurly, Chargebee, Apple App Store Connect, Google Play (mobile subscriptions)

---

### ProfitWell vs Baremetrics Comparison

| Feature | ProfitWell | Baremetrics | Winner |
|---------|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Pricing** | Free (Metrics), commission (Retain) | MRR-based | ProfitWell (lower barrier) |
| **Analytics Depth** | Basic | Comprehensive | Baremetrics |
| **Customization** | Limited | Extensive | Baremetrics |
| **Revenue Recovery** | Commission-based, no customization | Flat rate, full customization | Baremetrics |
| **Focus Area** | Automation & recovery | Analytics & reporting | Depends on need |
| **Metrics Tracked** | Comprehensive (similar to Baremetrics) | Comprehensive (similar to ProfitWell) | Tie |
| **Integration Support** | Zuora, Chargify, Recharge | Apple App Store, Google Play | Tie (different platforms) |

**Market Consensus:** Baremetrics is the more feature-complete tool, but ProfitWell's free Metrics product lowers barrier to entry.

---

### Relevance to E-commerce / BeProfit Competition

**Where They Compete with BeProfit:**

**1. Subscription Box E-commerce**
- **Examples:** Birchbox, Dollar Shave Club, HelloFresh, Stitch Fix
- **Model:** Recurring monthly subscriptions, not one-time purchases
- **Tool Choice:** ProfitWell or Baremetrics are BETTER choices than BeProfit
- **Reason:** MRR, churn, and cohort analysis are core to subscription business model; BeProfit's transactional focus doesn't fit

**2. Recharge/Bold Subscription Integration**
- Shopify merchants using subscription apps (Recharge, Bold, Smartrr) operate hybrid model: one-time + subscription
- **Conflict:** Should they use subscription-focused tool (ProfitWell/Baremetrics) or e-commerce profit tool (BeProfit)?
- **Market Opportunity:** Tool that handles BOTH models wins this segment

**3. D2C Brands with Loyalty Programs**
- Brands emphasizing repeat purchases (coffee, supplements, pet food) have subscription-like behavior even without formal subscriptions
- **Tool Choice Ambiguity:** Subscription analytics vs. e-commerce analytics
- **BeProfit's Positioning:** LTV and cohort analysis competes with subscription tools for this segment

---

**Where They DON'T Compete with BeProfit:**

1. **Marketplace Sellers** (Amazon, eBay) — ProfitWell/Baremetrics don't handle marketplace fees, shipping costs, COGS tracking
2. **Dropshippers** — Subscription tools don't track per-order profitability, supplier costs, or AliExpress integration
3. **Traditional E-commerce** (one-time purchase focus) — ProfitWell/Baremetrics designed for recurring revenue, not transactional

---

### Strategic Implication for BeProfit

**Threat Level:** LOW for core BeProfit market, MEDIUM for subscription e-commerce segment

**Market Segmentation:**
- **Subscription-heavy e-commerce** → ProfitWell/Baremetrics win
- **Transactional e-commerce** → BeProfit wins
- **Hybrid models** → Market up for grabs; best integration wins

**Opportunity:** If BeProfit built strong subscription analytics (MRR tracking, subscription-specific cohorts, churn analysis), it could capture hybrid model merchants. Currently, this segment must choose between tools or use both (expensive, fragmented).

---

## Part 3: Peel Insights — Premium Retention Analytics

### Market Positioning

**Peel Insights Position:** Premium retention analytics platform for customer-obsessed DTC teams

**Price Point:** Starting at $499/month (lowest tier) — significantly higher than BeProfit's $25-$250 range

   - Export custom audience lists to external platforms (Klaviyo, Facebook Ads)

**Critical Feedback:**

---

### Setup & Implementation

- No developer or coding knowledge required
- Pulls data from source automatically

**Time to Value:**
After installation:

**Comparison to BeProfit:** Similar setup ease, but Peel's deeper feature set requires more learning curve.

---

### Pricing Comparison: Peel vs BeProfit

| Tool | Entry Price | Mid-Tier Price | High-End Price | Target Customer |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **BeProfit** | $25/month | $99-$149/month | $249/month | Small to mid-market transactional merchants |
| **Peel Insights** | $499/month | Unknown | Unknown | Mid-market to enterprise DTC, subscription-heavy |

**Price Difference:** Peel is **5-20x more expensive** than BeProfit, indicating completely different market segments.

---

### Competitive Analysis: Peel vs BeProfit

#### Where Peel Wins

1. **Retention-Focused Brands**
   - DTC brands with strong repeat purchase behavior (coffee, supplements, beauty, pet)
   - Subscription businesses
   - Brands optimizing for LTV vs. transactional profit

2. **Analytics Maturity**
   - Teams with dedicated analytics/data roles
   - Brands wanting unlimited customization
   - Organizations needing to export audiences to marketing tools

3. **Subscription-Specific Needs**
   - MRR tracking
   - Subscription churn analysis
   - Subscriber conversion optimization

4. **Enterprise Budgets**
   - Brands with analytics budgets supporting $499+/month tools
   - Companies prioritizing retention as strategic priority

---

#### Where BeProfit Wins

1. **Budget-Conscious Merchants**
   - Small merchants needing profit tracking at $25-$99/month
   - Brands without analytics team/budget

2. **Transactional Focus**
   - Marketplace sellers (Amazon, eBay)
   - Dropshippers
   - One-time purchase businesses

3. **Operational Profit Priority**

4. **Simplicity**
   - Merchants wanting pre-built reports without custom dashboard complexity
   - Users without analytics background

---

#### Market Segmentation Impact

**Peel doesn't compete directly with BeProfit** — they serve different segments:

- **BeProfit:** Mid-market profit tracking for transactional merchants ($25-$250/month)

**Overlap Segment:**
- Mid-market DTC brands ($1-10M revenue) deciding between:
  - **Operational profit focus** → BeProfit
  - **Customer retention focus** → Peel
  - **Both priorities** → Use both tools (expensive) or choose one and compromise

**Strategic Opportunity:** Whoever builds "affordable retention analytics + operational profit tracking" wins the overlap segment.

---

- **Capabilities:**
  - Customer segmentation
  - Lifetime value (LTV) calculation
  - Partner segmentation
  - Sync with email platforms (Klaviyo, etc.) to optimize campaigns

- **Inventory Analytics:**
  - Inventory levels
  - Sell-through rates

---

### User Reviews & Reception

**Rating:** 4.3 stars on Shopify App Store (59 reviews)

#### Positive Feedback

1. **Daily Snapshot Email:**
   - "Hits your inbox every morning and lets you see how you did the previous day with revenue, AOV, CR, ad spend, etc."
   - Merchants value consistent daily reporting

2. **Depth Beyond Shopify:**
   - "Insights that are not native to Shopify, such as customer LTV, advertising performance and partner segmentation"
   - Fills gaps in Shopify's native analytics

3. **Accuracy:**
   - "GLEW is far more accurate than Google Analytics and provides much more depth than Shopify reports"
   - Shopify+ merchants especially value accuracy for high-volume stores

#### Critical Feedback

1. **Shopify's Native Analytics Improving:**
   - "Shopify's data is catching up to make Glew less valuable"
   - Some users feel it's "not enough to justify the high cost anymore"
   - **Threat to Glew:** Platform-native analytics improving reduces third-party tool value

2. **Customization Limitations:**
   - Users mention "limitations in report customization"
   - Ironic given Glew positions as BI platform with customization

3. **Data Accuracy Issues:**
   - "Occasional data accuracy issues" mentioned
   - "Mixed experiences on customer support"

4. **Cost Concerns:**
   - At $249+/month, price-sensitive merchants question ROI
   - "High cost" relative to value perceived

---

### Competitive Analysis: Glew vs BeProfit

#### Where Glew Wins

1. **Multi-Channel Complexity**
   - Merchants selling on Shopify + Amazon + Walmart + eBay + direct website
   - 150+ integrations handle complex tech stacks
   - BeProfit supports fewer platforms

2. **Agency Use Case**
   - Digital agencies managing multiple client stores
   - Unified reporting across client portfolio
   - BeProfit less suited for agency multi-client management

3. **Business Intelligence Needs**
   - Teams wanting BI platform vs. simple profit tracker
   - Custom reports beyond pre-built templates
   - Data warehouse/export capabilities

4. **Shopify+ Merchants**
   - High-volume merchants ($1M-$5M+) needing accuracy
   - Users report Glew "far more accurate" than Google Analytics and native Shopify
   - BeProfit may not handle high-volume scale as effectively

5. **Inventory-Centric Businesses**
   - Merchants needing inventory analytics + profit tracking
   - Sell-through rates, reorder points alongside profitability
   - BeProfit doesn't emphasize inventory management

---

#### Where BeProfit Wins

1. **Price Sensitivity**
   - BeProfit's $25-$99 plans vastly more affordable than Glew's $249+ entry
   - Small merchants can't justify Glew's cost

2. **Simplicity**
   - BeProfit's pre-built reports require less setup/learning curve
   - Glew's BI capabilities require analytics expertise to extract value

3. **Profit-Specific Focus**
   - Merchants wanting dedicated profit tracking vs. broad BI
   - BeProfit's focus on profitability vs. Glew's broader analytics

4. **Shopify Native Integration**
   - BeProfit's Shopify "staff pick" status signals tighter integration
   - As Shopify's native analytics improve, Glew's value diminishes but BeProfit's profit-specific focus remains differentiated

---

#### Market Segmentation Impact

**Glew and BeProfit target overlapping but distinct segments:**

- **Glew:** Multi-channel merchants, agencies, Shopify+ users needing BI platform ($249+/month)
- **BeProfit:** Single or dual-platform merchants needing profit tracking ($25-$250/month)

**Overlap Segment:**
- Mid-market Shopify merchants ($1M-$5M revenue) deciding between:
  - **BI capabilities** → Glew (higher cost, broader analytics)
  - **Profit focus** → BeProfit (lower cost, specialized)

**Competitive Threat to Glew:** Shopify's native analytics improvements directly undermine Glew's value proposition. User reviews explicitly mention this: "Shopify's data is catching up to make Glew less valuable."

**Implication for BeProfit:** Stay focused on profit-specific features (COGS tracking, per-order profitability, ad attribution) that Shopify native analytics won't replicate. Don't try to become full BI platform competing with Glew — that increases cost and complexity.

---

## Cross-Tool Comparison Matrix

| Feature | BeProfit | OrderMetrics (Defunct) | ProfitWell | Baremetrics | Peel Insights | Glew Analytics |
|---------|----------|----------------------|------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Profit Tracking | Order Tracking | SaaS Metrics | SaaS Metrics | Retention Analytics | Multi-Channel BI |

## Strategic Insights for Product Development

### What OrderMetrics' Failure Teaches Us

1. **Differentiation is critical** — Basic profit tracking commoditizes; need unique value proposition
2. **Market fragmentation accelerating** — Can't be "good enough" at everything; must excel at specific use case
3. **Mobile is table stakes** — Lack of mobile app is disqualifying for many merchants
4. **Feature velocity matters** — Stagnation leads to competitive displacement

---

### What ProfitWell/Baremetrics Success Teaches Us

1. **Subscription market is separate** — Subscription e-commerce has different analytics needs than transactional
2. **Free tier drives adoption** — ProfitWell's free Metrics product lowers barrier; BeProfit's free plan removal hurt perception
3. **Specialization wins** — Both tools focus exclusively on subscriptions vs. trying to serve all e-commerce
4. **Revenue recovery is valuable add-on** — Retain/Recover products show monetization beyond analytics

---

### What Peel Insights Success Teaches Us

1. **Premium market exists** — DTC brands will pay $499+/month for deep retention analytics
2. **Predictive analytics differentiate** — AI-powered LTV forecasting creates defensible value
3. **Custom segmentation is sticky** — Unlimited custom audiences create lock-in (hard to switch once workflows built)
4. **Retention focus is strategic** — Brands optimizing LTV need different tool than brands optimizing per-order profit

---

### What Glew Analytics Challenges Teach Us

1. **Platform-native analytics improving** — Shopify, Amazon native analytics getting better, reducing third-party tool value
2. **BI platform requires scale** — 150+ integrations and customization need large team to build/maintain
3. **Accuracy is critical** — Users cite accuracy as primary reason to pay for Glew; errors destroy trust
4. **Multi-channel is niche** — Most merchants are single-platform (Shopify) or dual-platform (Shopify + Amazon); 150+ integrations overkill

---

## Competitive Positioning Opportunities

### Where BeProfit Could Win

**1. Hybrid Model: Transactional + Subscription**
- Build strong subscription analytics (MRR, churn, cohort-specific to subscriptions)
- Combine with existing operational profit tracking
- Capture merchants using Recharge/Bold who need BOTH subscription metrics AND per-order profitability
- **Gap:** Currently these merchants must choose ProfitWell/Baremetrics OR BeProfit, not both in one

**2. Affordable Retention Analytics**
- Build Peel-like retention features at BeProfit pricing ($99-$149/month vs. Peel's $499+)
- Predictive LTV models (AI-powered)
- Customer journey mapping
- Advanced segmentation
- **Gap:** Premium retention analytics locked behind $499+ price point; mid-market can't afford

**3. Mobile-First Experience**
- Build iOS/Android apps (BeProfit currently has none)
- Real-time notifications (profit milestones, cost spikes, anomaly detection)
- Voice-activated queries ("Alexa, what was yesterday's profit?")
- **Gap:** Modern merchants expect mobile; BeProfit's lack is unacceptable to mobile-first segment

**4. Attribution Accuracy**
- Fix critical flaw: Track ALL ad spend, not just UTM-attributed
- Build server-side tracking for iOS 14.5+ post-ATT world
- First-party data collection (Shopify Pixel, custom events)
- **Gap:** BeProfit's UTM-only approach creates inaccurate profit numbers; merchants discovering this switch to TrueProfit

---

### Where BeProfit Should NOT Compete

**1. Don't Try to Be Glew** — Building 150+ integrations requires massive engineering resources; focus on Shopify + Amazon core

**2. Don't Try to Be Peel** — $499+/month premium market requires enterprise sales team, customer success resources BeProfit likely doesn't have

**3. Don't Try to Be ProfitWell** — SaaS analytics is different market; dilutes focus from e-commerce profit tracking core

**4. Don't Compete on Price** — Race to bottom with Profit Calc ($25/month) erodes margins without differentiation
