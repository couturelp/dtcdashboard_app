## Sign Up for Your Account

1. Go to [dtcdashboard.com/app/register](/app/register).
2. Enter your email address and create a password.
3. Check your inbox for a verification email and click the verification link.
4. Once verified, you will be redirected to your dashboard.

## Complete Your Store Profile

After signing in for the first time, you will need to set up your store profile:

1. Navigate to **Settings** from the sidebar.
2. Enter your store name and select your primary currency.
3. Add your Shopify store URL (e.g., `your-store.myshopify.com`).
4. Click **Save** to confirm your store profile.

Your store profile determines which currency your dashboard uses for all calculations. You can change this later in Settings.

## What Comes Next

With your account created and store profile set up, you are ready to:

- **Connect your data sources** through Fivetran (see [Connecting Your Data Sources](/help/integrations/connecting-data-sources-fivetran))
- **Upload your product costs** so your profit calculations are accurate (see [Uploading Product Costs via CSV](/help/cost-management/uploading-product-costs-csv))
- **Explore your dashboard** to understand what each section shows (see [Understanding Your Dashboard: A Quick Tour](/help/getting-started/understanding-your-dashboard))

Your dashboard will start showing data once your first Fivetran sync completes, which typically happens within a few hours of connecting your Shopify store.
