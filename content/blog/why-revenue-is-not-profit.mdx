## The Revenue Illusion

Every Shopify store owner knows the feeling. You open your dashboard, see a strong revenue number, and feel a rush of accomplishment. But here is the uncomfortable truth: revenue is a vanity metric. It tells you how much money came in, not how much you actually kept.

The gap between revenue and profit is where most DTC brands get blindsided. That $100,000 month might look impressive until you account for the $35,000 in product costs, $8,000 in shipping, $15,000 in ad spend, $4,000 in transaction fees, and $12,000 in operating expenses. Suddenly your "six-figure month" delivered $26,000 in actual profit, a 26% margin that could easily shrink further.

## The Hidden Costs Most Brands Overlook

### 1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

Your product costs go beyond the purchase price from your supplier. COGS should include manufacturing, packaging, labeling, duties and import fees, and any quality control costs. Many brands undercount their true COGS by 10 to 15%.

### 2. Shipping and Fulfillment

Shipping is rarely as simple as the rate your carrier quotes. Factor in packaging materials, pick and pack fees if using a 3PL, return shipping costs, and zone-based rate variations. The average ecommerce brand spends 8 to 12% of revenue on shipping and fulfillment.

### 3. Transaction and Platform Fees

Shopify takes its cut, your payment processor takes its cut, and if you sell on marketplaces, they take their cut too. These fees typically run 3 to 5% of every transaction, adding up quickly at scale.

### 4. Marketing and Advertising

Your Meta Ads and Google Ads spend is the most visible cost, but it is rarely the only marketing expense. Include creative production, influencer payments, email platform costs, and any agency retainers in your true marketing cost.

### 5. Operating Expenses

Rent, software subscriptions, employee salaries, insurance, accounting fees. These fixed costs eat into profit regardless of how much you sell. They are easy to ignore when calculating product-level profitability, but they determine whether your business is actually viable.

## How to Calculate Your Real Profit

The formula is straightforward, but getting accurate inputs requires discipline:

**Gross Profit** = Revenue - COGS - Shipping - Transaction Fees

**Contribution Profit** = Gross Profit - Ad Spend - Variable Marketing Costs

**Net Profit** = Contribution Profit - Operating Expenses

Most brands stop at gross profit and call it a day. But contribution profit and net profit are the numbers that tell you whether your business model actually works.

## Stop Guessing, Start Tracking

The biggest obstacle to accurate profit tracking is scattered data. Your revenue lives in Shopify, ad spend lives in Meta and Google, product costs live in spreadsheets, and operating expenses live in your accounting software. Pulling all of this together manually is tedious and error-prone.

This is exactly the problem DTC Dashboard solves. By connecting your Shopify store and ad platforms, combining them with your product costs and expenses, you get a single view of your true profitability, updated automatically as your data syncs.
