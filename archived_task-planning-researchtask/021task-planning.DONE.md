**Header Structure:**
```markdown
# BeProfit Pricing Psychology Analysis

## Source
- **Primary URL:** https://beprofit.co/pricing
- **Category:** Marketing Website / Pricing Psychology
- **Date Captured:** [to be filled during research]
- **Research Status:** ⚠️ TEMPLATE - Requires manual website research using `marketing-psychology` skill

## Research Objective
Analyze BeProfit's pricing page through a behavioral psychology and marketing psychology lens, identifying persuasion tactics, cognitive bias applications, anchoring strategies, decoy effects, tier positioning, urgency tactics, and pricing framing. This analysis informs optimal pricing psychology for our competing product.

## Research Method
This analysis should be conducted using the `marketing-psychology` skill available via the Skill tool. The skill provides 70+ mental models and psychological principles organized for marketing application.
```

**Main Content Sections:**

1. **Anchoring & Reference Pricing**
   - Price anchoring tactics used
     - Is annual pricing anchored by showing monthly equivalent (e.g., "$99/month billed annually" vs "$199 monthly")
     - Is enterprise pricing used to anchor lower tiers as "affordable"
     - Are original prices shown with discounts (strikethrough pricing)
   - Reference price framing
     - Cost-per-order framing (e.g., "Just $0.50 per order")
     - ROI framing (e.g., "Save $X per month in ad spend")
     - Competitive comparison pricing (e.g., "50% less than competitor X")
   - Mental accounting implications
     - How payment frequency affects perceived value (monthly vs annual)
     - Bundling effects (all features vs à la carte add-ons)

2. **Decoy Effect & Tier Positioning**
   - Identify if a decoy plan exists (plan designed to make another plan more attractive)
     - Example: Middle tier priced close to highest tier to push users to highest tier
   - Asymmetric dominance analysis
     - Does one plan clearly dominate another on key features at similar price?
   - Goldilocks effect (three-tier positioning)
     - Are three tiers used to position middle tier as "just right"?
   - Which plan is visually emphasized
     - "Most Popular" badge placement
     - Larger card size or highlighted background color
     - "Recommended" labels

3. **Loss Aversion & Risk Reduction**
   - Free trial framing
     - "Try before you buy" messaging
     - "No credit card required" (reduces perceived risk)
     - "Cancel anytime" (reduces commitment anxiety)
   - Money-back guarantee framing
     - "30-day money-back guarantee" (reduces purchase risk)
     - "Satisfaction guaranteed" messaging
   - Feature loss framing
     - Are downgrades positioned as "losing features" vs upgrades as "gaining features"
   - FOMO (fear of missing out) tactics
     - "Limited time offer" on pricing page
     - "Most stores choose [plan]" social proof

4. **Scarcity & Urgency Tactics**
   - Artificial scarcity
     - "Only X spots left at this price"
     - "Limited beta access" mentions
   - Time-based urgency
     - Countdown timers on discounts
     - "Offer expires" messaging
     - Seasonal pricing promotions
   - Implied scarcity
     - "Join 10,000+ stores" (implies others are taking action)

5. **Annual vs Monthly Pricing Strategy**
   - Annual discount percentage (30%? 40%? More?)
   - Annual discount framing
     - "Save 2 months" (outcome framing)
     - "40% off" (percentage framing)
     - "Only $X/month when billed annually" (reduce payment pain)
   - Default selection (is annual pre-selected or monthly?)
   - Toggle prominence (is annual/monthly toggle obvious or subtle?)
   - Cash flow psychology
     - Does annual pricing reduce payment pain through single transaction?
     - Does monthly pricing reduce commitment anxiety?

6. **Social Proof & Authority**
   - Customer count ("Used by 10,000+ stores")
   - Revenue/order volume processed ("$1B+ tracked")
   - Ratings/reviews ("4.9/5 stars")
   - Customer logos (recognizable brands)
   - Awards/certifications on pricing page
   - Testimonials specific to pricing/value
   - Case study links from pricing page

7. **Pricing Presentation & Framing**
   - Price format
     - "$99" vs "$99.00" (psychological price points)
     - Large font on price vs small font on "per month"
   - Charm pricing (prices ending in 9, e.g., $99 vs $100)
   - Price complexity vs simplicity
     - Simple flat pricing vs complex tiered limits
   - Feature framing
     - "Everything in [lower tier] plus..." (additive framing)
     - "Unlock" language (achievement framing)

8. **Paradox of Choice**
   - Number of plans offered (3-5 is optimal, more causes paralysis)
   - Feature matrix complexity
     - Is matrix overwhelming or digestible?
     - Are key differentiating features highlighted?
   - Recommendation guidance
     - "Most popular for [user type]" labels
     - Plan recommendation quiz or selector
     - Chat/sales assistance CTA for undecided users

9. **Reciprocity & Free Tier Strategy**
   - Free tier positioning
     - Is free tier generous (reciprocity) or limited (upsell pressure)?
     - Free tier as lead magnet vs functional product
   - Free trial positioning
     - Does free trial create obligation to reciprocate (try full features, feel indebted)?
   - Educational content on pricing page
     - ROI calculators (provide value, create reciprocity)
     - Pricing guides (help users, expect conversion)

10. **Endowment Effect & Commitment Escalation**
    - Free trial to paid conversion tactics
      - Do users set up significant configuration during trial (endowment)?
      - Does trial create data history users don't want to lose?
    - Upgrade paths
      - Is upgrading framed as keeping what you have + more?
      - Are downgrades made psychologically painful?
    - Lock-in mechanisms visible in pricing
      - Historical data retention limits (lose data if you downgrade)
      - Integration configurations (lose integrations if downgrade)

11. **Comparison to Competitor Pricing Psychology**
    - How does BeProfit's pricing psychology compare to competitors (Triple Whale, Lifetimely, etc.)?
    - Unique psychological tactics used by BeProfit
    - Psychological tactics NOT used that competitors employ
    - Opportunities for superior pricing psychology

**Analysis Framework:**
- Effectiveness: How well does BeProfit apply pricing psychology principles?
- Ethical Concerns: Are any tactics manipulative vs persuasive?
- Conversion Optimization: Which tactics are likely most effective for conversion?
- Competitive Gaps: What pricing psychology tactics could our competitor use that BeProfit doesn't?

**Relevance to Our Build:**
Section documenting optimal pricing psychology tactics for our competitor, ethical persuasion techniques to adopt, manipulative tactics to avoid, and opportunities to out-optimize BeProfit's pricing conversions through superior behavioral design.

**File size estimate:** ~900 lines (detailed psychology analysis)

   - Beta integration program

10. **Marketing vs Reality Comparison**
    Compare integrations marketing page against help center integration documentation (from PRD Part 03, files 036-050):

    Table format:
    ```
    | Integration | Marketed on Page? | Documented in Help Center? | Status | Notes |
    |------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------|-------|
    | Shopify | Yes - Featured | Yes - Full docs | Match | ... |
    | TikTok Ads | Yes - Listed | Yes - Full docs | Match | ... |
    | [Platform X] | Yes - Featured | No docs found | Overpromise? | Check if actually live |
    | [Platform Y] | No - Not mentioned | Yes - Docs exist | Under-marketed | Opportunity |
    ```

    Analysis:
    - Integrations marketed but not documented in help center (potential vaporware)
    - Integrations documented in help center but not marketed (under-promoted)
    - Discrepancies in integration capabilities (marketing claims vs help docs)

11. **Plan Tier Integration Limits**
    - Are integration limits mentioned on this page or only on pricing page?
    - Free tier integration access (which integrations, how many accounts)
    - Paid tier integration access (all integrations? limits per platform?)
    - Enterprise integration options (custom integrations, API access)

12. **Competitive Positioning**
    - Integration breadth claims vs competitors
    - "More integrations than [competitor]" claims
    - Unique integrations BeProfit has that competitors don't
    - Integration quality claims vs quantity claims

**Analysis Framework:**
- Integration Coverage: How comprehensive is the integration ecosystem?
- Marketing Honesty: Do integration claims match help center documentation?
- Competitive Strength: How does integration marketing compare to competitors?
- Under-Marketed Gems: What integrations exist but aren't prominently marketed?

**Relevance to Our Build:**
Section documenting which integrations our competitor must prioritize, how to market integration ecosystem effectively, which integration claims to verify before marketing, and opportunities to provide clearer/more comprehensive integration marketing than BeProfit.

**File size estimate:** ~850 lines (comprehensive integrations marketing analysis)

- [ ] Checkpoint: File 089 created with comprehensive integrations marketing template

### Step 5: Update PRD Part 06 Progress Section
**Files:** prd/detailed_prd_part_06.md (MODIFY)

After creating all 4 template files (086-089), update the PRD's Progress section to reflect Task 021 completion.

**Add new progress entry after existing Task 020 entry (after line 122):**
```markdown
### Task 021 - [DATE]
- Status: COMPLETED
- Summary: Created next 4 research template files for PRD Part 06 (files 086-089). Covered Remaining Feature Pages (COGS, shipping, customer analytics, etc.), Pricing Page Full Documentation, Pricing Psychology Analysis, and Integrations Marketing Page.
- Files changed:
  - Created `dtcdashboard_app/casestudy/beprofit-casestudy-info-086.md` (~800 lines — Remaining Feature Pages)
  - Created `dtcdashboard_app/casestudy/beprofit-casestudy-info-087.md` (~900 lines — Pricing Page Full Documentation)
  - Created `dtcdashboard_app/casestudy/beprofit-casestudy-info-088.md` (~900 lines — Pricing Psychology Analysis)
  - Created `dtcdashboard_app/casestudy/beprofit-casestudy-info-089.md` (~850 lines — Integrations Marketing Page)
- Note: Files are research templates requiring manual website research using `agent-browser`, `copywriting`, `marketing-psychology`, and other skills to populate with actual BeProfit.co marketing content.
```

**Update the Cumulative Progress section (lines 124-139) to mark Tasks 6-9 as complete:**
```markdown
### Cumulative Progress
- [x] Task 1: Features Pages Overview & Navigation (file 081 - TEMPLATE CREATED in Task 020)
- [x] Task 2: Profit Analytics Feature Page (file 082 - TEMPLATE CREATED in Task 020)
- [x] Task 3: Order & Product Analytics Feature Pages (file 083 - TEMPLATE CREATED in Task 020)

- [x] Task 7: Pricing Page Documentation (file 087 - TEMPLATE CREATED in Task 021)
- [x] Task 8: Pricing Psychology Analysis (file 088 - TEMPLATE CREATED in Task 021)
- [x] Task 9: Integrations Marketing Page (file 089 - TEMPLATE CREATED in Task 021)
- [ ] Task 10: Individual Integration Landing Pages (file 090 - NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Task 11: Case Studies & Testimonials (file 091 - NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Task 12: Partner / Agency Pages (file 092 - NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Task 13: Comparison Pages (file 093 - NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Task 14: Demo, Tour & Other Landing Pages (file 094 - NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Task 15: Checkpoint Review #6 (file 095 - NOT STARTED)
```

**Update the Remaining Work section (lines 141-152):**
```markdown
### Remaining Work for This PRD
**PRD Part 06 Status: 9 of 15 tasks complete (60% complete)**

Remaining tasks for PRD Part 06:
- Tasks 10-15: Create remaining 6 research template files (090-095)
  - Task 10: Individual Integration Landing Pages template (file 090)
  - Task 11: Case Studies & Testimonials Pages template (file 091)
  - Task 12: Partner / Agency Pages template (file 092)
  - Task 13: Comparison Pages template (file 093)
  - Task 14: Demo, Tour & Other Landing Pages template (file 094)
  - Task 15: Checkpoint Review #6 (file 095)

After all 15 template files are created, manual research will be required to populate templates with actual BeProfit.co marketing content.
```

**Integration approach:** Use the Edit tool to:
1. Add Task 021 entry after Task 020 entry (after line 122)
2. Update Cumulative Progress checkboxes for tasks 6-9 (lines 130-133)
3. Update completion percentage from 33% to 60% (line 142)
4. Update "Remaining tasks" section to reflect only 6 tasks remaining (lines 144-150)

- [ ] Checkpoint: PRD updated with Task 021 completion status

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] File 086 (Remaining Feature Pages) created with sections for COGS, shipping, customer analytics, inventory, multi-store, mobile app, API, and cross-feature analysis

- [ ] PRD Part 06 Progress section updated to reflect Task 021 completion and show 9 of 15 tasks complete (60%)
- [ ] File size estimates are reasonable (800-900 lines per file, ~3,450 lines total)

## Notes

### Template Consistency Requirements
All 4 files must maintain consistency with established templates from Task 020 (files 081-085):
- Same header structure with Source, Category, Date, Research Status
- Research Objective section clearly stating the goal
- Structured main content sections with analysis questions and numbered subsections
- Analysis Framework section with strategic evaluation questions
- "Relevance to Our Build" section connecting findings to competitor strategy
- Cross-referencing help center documentation where applicable

### Critical Cross-References
Files 086-089 must include sections comparing marketing claims against product reality documented in earlier PRD parts:
- **File 086 (Remaining Features):** Cross-reference PRD Part 02 (Reports), Part 03 (Integrations), Part 04 (Settings)
- **File 087 (Pricing Documentation):** Cross-reference all PRD parts to validate which features are actually available
- **File 088 (Pricing Psychology):** Use `marketing-psychology` skill framework for analysis
- **File 089 (Integrations Marketing):** Cross-reference PRD Part 03 (files 036-050) comprehensively

### Pricing Intelligence Priority
Files 087 and 088 are the most strategically important in this batch - they provide complete competitive pricing intelligence. Extra detail and thoroughness required:
- Capture EVERY feature in the pricing matrix (miss nothing)
- Document EVERY usage limit precisely
- Analyze EVERY psychological tactic used

### File Size Management
Target file sizes:
- File 086: ~800 lines (multiple features covered)
- File 087: ~900 lines (exhaustive pricing detail required)
- File 088: ~900 lines (detailed psychology analysis)
- File 089: ~850 lines (comprehensive integration marketing)
Total: ~3,450 lines across 4 files

After Task 021:
- ✅ Files 081-085 created in Task 020 (Tasks 1-5)
- ✅ Files 086-089 created in Task 021 (Tasks 6-9)
- ⏳ Files 090-095 pending (Tasks 10-15) - to be handled in Task 022
