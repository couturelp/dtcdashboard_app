  - `beprofit-casestudy-info-135.md` (22KB) - Comparison Article Analysis
- **Key Findings:** TrueProfit is primary competitive threat; BeProfit has critical attribution weakness (UTM-only tracking); market fragmented by use case; spreadsheet transition occurs at $20-50K/month revenue
- **Research Scope:** 50+ web searches, 80+ sources cited, strategic recommendations included

### Task 035 - 2026-02-13
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Summary:** Completed market landscape research, company background investigation, social media audit, Product Hunt launch analysis, and job postings intelligence for Tasks 6-10. Delivered comprehensive understanding of e-commerce profit analytics market ($28.64-60.59B by 2026-2030), BeProfit's corporate trajectory (founded 2016, pivoted 2020, acquired by Viably Oct 2024), social media strategy (4,143 LinkedIn followers, moderate B2B presence), Product Hunt launch performance (98 upvotes Nov 28, 2020), and hiring signals (28 employees, Python/React stack, post-acquisition freeze).
- **Files Created:**
  - `beprofit-casestudy-info-136.md` (~21KB) - Market Landscape Analysis

- **Research Scope:** 60+ web searches, 100+ sources cited across 5 comprehensive research documents

### Task 036 - 2026-02-13
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Summary:** Completed final research phase for PRD Part 08, delivering YouTube tutorial analysis (File 141), API documentation research (File 142), pricing history tracking (File 143), strategic market opportunities synthesis (File 144), and comprehensive checkpoint review (File 145).

Post-acquisition integration distraction creates Q1 2026 launch window. Strategic synthesis identifies platform-native attribution, mobile apps, public API, and generous free tier as top 4 MVP priorities.
- **Research Scope:** 40+ web searches, 50+ sources cited, comprehensive synthesis of all 13 previous research files (131-143) into actionable strategic recommendations
